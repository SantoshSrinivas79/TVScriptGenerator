                the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.


                Jerry: What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter 
                with that? What about that one?


                Elaine: Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?


                Jerry: He was good in Man From Uncle.


                Elaine: Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?


                Jerry: I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.


                Elaine: Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because 
                that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked 
                people.


                Jerry: No, I don't wanna see the naked people.


                Elaine: Been a while?


                Jerry: I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, 
                but it was a long, long time ago.


                Elaine: I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot 
                shorter.


                Jerry: I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do 
                it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)


                Elaine: What?


                Jerry: What?


                Elaine: What was that look?


                Jerry: What look?


                Elaine: The look you just gave me.


                Jerry: I gave a look?


                Elaine: Yes.


                Jerry: What kind of look?


                Elaine: I know that look.


                Jerry: Then what was it?


                Elaine: Why should I tell you?


                Jerry: Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart 
                you are.


                Elaine: Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...


                Jerry: What?


                Elaine: What about the look?


                Jerry: I don't know.


                Elaine: You got something on your mind?


                Jerry: No. Things pop into your head. You?


                Elaine: Things occur to me from time to time.


                Jerry: Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the 
                past completely.


                Elaine: No, of course not.


                Jerry: I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? 
                Twenty-five times?


                Elaine: Thirty-seven.


                Jerry: Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points 
                to bedroom)


                Elaine: We know the terrain.


                Jerry: No big surprises.


                Elaine: Nope.


                Jerry: What do you think?


                Elaine: I don't know. What do you think?


                Jerry: Well, it's something to consider.


                Elaine: Yeah.


                Jerry: I mean, let's say we did.


                Elaine: What if.


                Jerry: Is that like the end of the world or something?


                Elaine: Certainly not.


                Jerry: Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if 
                we want to?


                Elaine: I know.


                Jerry: I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points 
                to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back 
                out here. It's not complicated.



                Elaine: It's almost stupid if we didn't.


                Jerry: It's moronic.


                Elaine: Absurd!


                Jerry: Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.


                Elaine: We, there are always a few.


                Jerry: I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends 
                the way we are now, that would be really bad.


                Elaine: Devastating.


                Jerry: Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between 
                them to indicate friendship)


                Elaine: And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)


                Jerry: That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and 
                the that. But this cannot be disturbed.


                Elaine: Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.


                Jerry: But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the 
                things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.


                Elaine: Huh.


                Jerry: For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and 
                vice versa.


                Elaine: Right.


                Jerry: But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation 
                to call.


                Elaine: Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an 
                idea. No call the day after that.


                Jerry: Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.


                Elaine: All right, sir.


                Jerry: Now here's another little rule. When we see each other 
                now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people 
                get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When 
                that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't 
                see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.


                Elaine: Okay, okay. Spending the night is optional!


                Jerry: Well now we're gettin' somewhere.


                Elaine: What about the kiss goodnight?


                Jerry: Tough one. You're call.


                Elaine: It's brug-wa (?).


                Jerry: Fine. Well.


                Elaine: Well.


                Jerry: You ready?


                Elaine: Ready.


                Jerry: So think you can handle this?


                Elaine: Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)

                Kramer: Got the paper?


                Jerry: Not yet.


                Kramer: No paper?


                Jerry: I haven't been out yet.


                Kramer: Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the 
                bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He

                George: What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or 
                was he just restricted to water?


                Jerry: No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's 
                the job situation goin'?


                George: Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?


                Jerry: Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.


                George: Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.


                Jerry: I thought you'd like that.


                George: Oh, this is huge!


                Jerry: I know.


                George: All right, okay. Let's go, details.


                Jerry: No, I can't do details.


                George: You wha?


                Jerry: I can't give details.


                George: No details?


                Jerry: I'm not in the mood.


                George: You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, 
                and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen 
                to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have 
                a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you 
                get in the mood!


                Jerry: All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.


                George: Where are you sitting?


                Jerry: On the couch.


                George: Next to each other?


                Jerry: No, separated.



                George: Time?


                Jerry: About eleven.


                George: Okay, go ahead.


                Jerry: So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked 
                station.


                George: Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because 
                of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never 
                turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen 
                would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there 
                in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. 
                So you're watching the naked station.


                Jerry: And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we 
                had sex.


                George: Boy, these are really bad details.


                Jerry: It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature 
                for details.


                George: Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates 
                me.


                Jerry: Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.


                George: Better than before?


                Jerry: She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.


                George: This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's 
                going on? Are you like a couple again now?


                Jerry: Not exactly.


                George: Not exactly. What does that mean?


                Jerry: Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be 
                able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George 
                laughs hysterically and stands oiut of his seat)


                George: Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? 
                It's impossible. It can't be done.
                (He sits back down) Thousands of years people have been trying 
                to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two 
                of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the 
                ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.


                Jerry: I think we've worked out a system.


                George: Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic 
                gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking 
                he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.


                Jerry: No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules 
                that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship 
                pitfalls.


                George: Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.


                Jerry: Okay. No calls the next day.


                George: (To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't 
                have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.


                Jerry: You ready for the second one?


                George: I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.


                Jerry: Spending the night. Optional.


                George: No, you see? You got greedy.


                Jerry: No, that's the rule. It's optional.


                George: I know less about women than anyone in the world. But 
                one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the 
                night. I could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning 
                and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with 
                French fry) You're not going anywhere.

                impression there's a problem.

                Elaine: Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.


                Jerry: But you said, it can be very serious.


                Elaine: Okay, so fine. Go.


                Jerry: What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was 
                optional.


                Elaine: Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.

                Tina: I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one 
                of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have 
                to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up

                George: Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.


                Jerry: No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever 
                I spend, you have to spend half.


                George: What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?


                Jerry: You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. 
                Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from 
                all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.


                George: What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.

                George: Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another 
                guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, 
                perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.

                months. Oh, the card. (She opens)


                Elaine: Cash?


                Jerry: Would do you think?


                Elaine: You got me cash?


                Jerry: Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself 
                whatever you want. No good?


                Elaine: Who are you, my uncle?


                Jerry: Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's 
                anything to sneeze at.


                Elaine: Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a 
                great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)


                Kramer: Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. 
                I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)


                Elaine: Pal? You think I'm your pal?



                Jerry: I said, "and more."


                Elaine: I am not your pal.


                Jerry: What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? 
                (Kramer enters with present)


                Elaine: Oh, what is this? You got me something?


                Kramer: Yeah. Open it.


                Elaine: Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the 
                bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)


                Kramer: That's pretty good, huh?


                Jerry: Great.


                Kramer: Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned 
                it? I made a mental note of it.


                Jerry: Well goody for you.


                Kramer: Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's 
                birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?


                Jerry: 182 bucks.


                Kramer: Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? 
                That's like something her uncle would get her.


                Elaine: (Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and 
                ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.


                Kramer: (To Jerry) Yeats.


                Elaine: Oh Kramer. (They embrace)


                Jerry: Could you excuse us please?


                Kramer: What?


                Jerry: We're talking.


                Kramer: Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)


                Jerry: You know, we never had one fight before this deal.


                Elaine: I know.


                Jerry: Never.


                Elaine: Ever.


                Jerry: We got along beautifully.


                Elaine: Like clams.


                Jerry: It was wonderful.


                Elaine: A pleasure.


                Jerry: So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go 
                back to being friends.


                Elaine: I can't do it.


                Jerry: You what?


                Elaine: I can't do that.


                Jerry: You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or 
                that. Oh, boy. What do you want?


                Elaine: This, that, and the other.


                Jerry: Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want 
                this, that, and the other?


                Elaine: You.


                Jerry: (Starts to correct then realizes) Well...


                % Jerry and George at Monk's.


                George: Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. 
                If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday 
                will always bring it out.


                Jerry: I never should have made up those rules.


                George: What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is 
                it the touching? Is it the nudity?


                Jerry: It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible 
                fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.


                George: You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.


                Jerry: Why?


                George: It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me 
                anyway because of my birthday present.


                Jerry: What did you end up giving her?


                George: 91 dollars.


                Jerry: Sorry about that.


                George: So what're you gonna do?


                Jerry: Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. 
                This is pretty much it.


                George: So, maybe this should be it.


                Jerry: Could be it.


                George: She seems like an it.


                Jerry: She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the 
                street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, 
                they live in Vermont...


                George: We'd have to kill him.


                Jerry: We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.


                George: I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear 
                that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy 
                who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom 
                in front of hundreds of people.


                Jerry: Plus, you know what else.


                George: You better call her.


                % Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.



                Kramer: Hey.


                Jerry: Hey.


                Kramer: You got the paper yet?


                Jerry: Yeah.


                Kramer: Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) 
                Hey, you done with that?


                Elaine: No.


                Kramer: Well, you're not reading it now.


                Elaine: All right, you can take it. But I want it back.


                Kramer: Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?


                Elaine: Ah, this. And that.


                Jerry: And the other.


                Kramer: Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you 
                weren't a couple. (He exits)



              Opening monologue.
              Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the car 
              will behave as
              if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone 
              disturbs it,
              it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. 
              Not
              everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't 
              it be nice
              if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? You 
              know, somebody
              tries to break in, it goes, "Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?" I 
              would like a car alarm
              like that.


              First scene.
              Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.

              Jerry: Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.

              George: Was the alarm on?

              Jerry: I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; 
              I'm not
              tuned in to it like it's my son.

              George: I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?

              Jerry: They cross the wires or something.

              George: Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.

              Kramer enters.

              Jerry: They stole my car.

              Kramer: Who did?

              Jerry: They did.

              Kramer: Was it more than just one?

              Jerry: What should I do, should I call the police?

              Kramer: What are they gonna do?

              Jerry: I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.

              George: Maybe you should call your car phone.

              Jerry: Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.

              George: Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.

              Jerry: Are you serious?

              George: Yeah, go ahead, call.

              Jerry: I don't even know if I remember the number.

              Jerry dials.

              Jerry: What do I say if he picks up?

              Car thief: Hello?

              Jerry: Hello? Is this 555-8383?

              Car thief: I have no idea.

              Jerry: Can I ask you a question?

              Car thief: Sure.

              Jerry: Did you steal my car?

              Car thief: Yes I did.

              Jerry: You did?!

              Car thief: I did.

              Jerry: That's my car!

              Car thief: I didn't know it was yours.

              Jerry: What are you gonna do with it?

              Car thief: I dunno, drive around.

              Jerry: Then can I have it back?

              Car thief: Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it.

              Kramer gestures for Jerry to hand him the phone.

              Kramer: Hello?

              Car thief: Yeah, who's this?

              Kramer: Kramer.

              Car thief: Hello, Kramer.

              Kramer: Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.

              Car thief: Wait, hold on... Brown ones?

              Kramer: Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them 
              by my
              building, it's 129 West 81st St.

              Car thief: One-two-nine, okay.

              Kramer: Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.

              Jerry (derisively at Kramer): Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?

              Car thief: Jerry?

              Jerry: Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?

              Car thief: I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.

              Jerry: Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive 
              carefully.

              Car thief: Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because 
              I can't find
              the--

              Jerry hangs up.

              Jerry: Sid left the keys in the car.

              George: Who's Sid?

              Jerry: He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.

              George: What do you mean?

              Jerry: He moves them from one side of the street to the other so 
              you don't get
              a ticket.

              George: What, do you pay him for that?

              Jerry: Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.

              George: How many people does he do that for?

              Jerry: The whole block, forty, fifty cars.

              Kramer: He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course 

              he's been
              doing that for years, right Jerry?

              George: Could anybody do that?

              Sid enters.

              Jerry: Hey Sid, what happened?

              Sid: I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.

              Jerry: You left the keys in the car?

              Sid: Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the 
              block, and all
              those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got 
              a little
              distracted.

              Kramer: You know I'm in that movie?

              George: You are?

              Kramer: Yeah, I'm an extra.

              George: How'd you get that?

              Kramer: Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy 
              just asked
              me.

              George: Right out of the clear blue sky?

              Kramer: Clear blue sky!

              George: Well, why didn't they ask me?

              Kramer: I got a quality.

              Sid: Jerry, you got insurance, right?

              Jerry: Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.

              Sid: Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, 
              for a
              week, so I can't park it.

              Jerry: This Wednesday?

              Sid: No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.

              Jerry: But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.

              Sid: If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. 
              It's the
              week after this Wednesday.

              George: Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?

              Sid: Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They 
              can move
              themselves if they want.

              George: Maybe I could move them until you get back.

              Sid: What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't 
              work?

              George: I'm in a transition phase right now.

              Sid: Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't 
              forget to
              take the keys out, that's all.

              Phone rings.

              Jerry: Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just 
              slide it all
              the way over. You're welcome.


              New scene.
              Jerry and Elaine are in line at the rental car agency.

              Elaine: I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like 
              he's reading
              from one of his novels.

              Jerry: Owen March, I never heard of him.

              Elaine: Well, he's not a baseball player.

              Jerry: Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty 
              good.

              Elaine: Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.

              Jerry: What's that?

              Elaine: He's sixty-six years old.

              Rental car agent: Next please.

              Elaine: Well, go, go.

              Agent: Can I help you? Name please?

              Jerry: Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's 
              a small. I'm
              kidding around, of course.

              Agent: Okay, let's see here.

              Jerry: Sixty-six years old?

              Elaine: Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. 
              You'd
              really like him.

              Jerry: Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would 
              I like him?

              Elaine: What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year 
              old woman?

              Jerry: Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. 
              So vibrant,
              she'd be spinning.

              Agent: I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

              Jerry: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my 
              reservation?

              Agent: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.

              Jerry: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have 
              the
              reservation.

              Agent: I know why we have reservations.

              Jerry: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you 
              know how to
              take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation 
              and
              that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. 
              Anybody
              can just take them.

              Agent: Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.

              The agent goes into an office with a window in the door so she can 
              be seen
              speaking with someone.

              Jerry: Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying 
              over there?

              Elaine: What?

              Jerry: Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think 
              I'm talking
              to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start 
              talking.

              Elaine: Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something 
              but I'm
              not really saying anything at all?

              Jerry: Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause 
              they thought
              I was checking with you.

              Elaine: Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.

              The agent returns.

              Agent: I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.

              Jerry: Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over 
              there.

              Agent: But we do have a compact if you would like that.

              Jerry: Fine.

              Agent: Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. 
              Would you
              like insurance?

              Jerry: Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna 
              beat the hell
              out of this car.

              Agent: Please fill this out.

              Elaine: What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?

              Jerry: Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.


              Elaine: I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's 
              okay being
              with him.


              New scene.
              Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.

              Elaine: I just don't enjoy being with him.

              Jerry: Well that's what's important.

              Elaine: I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, 
              do I have to
              break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over 
              the phone?

              Jerry: How many times you been out with him?

              Elaine: Seven?

              Jerry: Face to face.

              Elaine: Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?

              Jerry: If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, 
              is over
              the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.

              Elaine: Hmm... How's the pasta over there?

              Kramer enters, as he's walking in, George rushes in, pushes him 
              out of the way
              and heads for the kitchen sink.

              Kramer: Whoa, whoa!!

              Jerry: What is going on out there?

              George: I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, 
              I got an alarm
              that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! 
              What do I
              do?! Help me! Help me!

              George runs off into the bathroom.

              Kramer: Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?

              Elaine: Today?!

              Kramer: You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the 
              block
              carrying this bag of groceries.

              Elaine: Yeah.

              Kramer: So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes 
              flying, and
              Woody, Woody starts laughing.

              Elaine: He was laughing?!

              Kramer: Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out 
              of his nose.

              Jerry: So then what?

              Kramer: I got a line in the movie!

              Elaine: Get out!

              Jerry: That's great!

              George: You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?

              Kramer: Pretty good, huh?

              George: You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?

              Kramer: Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new 
              career on my
              hands, huh?

              Jerry: You mean *a* career.

              Elaine: So was Mia Farrow there?

              Kramer: Uh, I didn't see him.

              Elaine: What's your line?

              Kramer: Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm 
              at this bar
              and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?

              The other three impatiently encourage Kramer to continue.

              Kramer: So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him 
              and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."

              George: Is that how you're gonna say it?

              Kramer: No, no, I'm working on it.

              Elaine: Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."

              Jerry: No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."

              Kramer: No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to 
              act.

              George: "These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"

              Jerry pinches his nose.

              George: That was no good? 

              Kramer: I didn't say anything.

              Elaine: I'm gonna go break up with Owen.

              George: What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! 
              Do you
              know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar 
              a really long
              time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman 
              and he's
              parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! 
              Alright! 
              Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are 
              making me
              thirsty!

              George storms out.


              New scene. 
              Still Jerry's apartment, some time later. There's a pounding on 
              the door, Jerry
              opens it and Elaine enters with an unconscious older man.

              Jerry: Oh my god.

              Elaine: Call an ambulance.

              Jerry: Boy, he took it hard.


              New scene.
              Owen is now lying on Jerry's couch and Elaine is explaining what 
              happened.

              Elaine: We were walking down the block right by your house and I 
              was just about
              to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.

              Jerry (on the phone): Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty 
              nine west
              Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.

              Elaine: Tell then to hurry! Hurry!

              Jerry (To Elaine): It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't 
              know but he's
              unconscious.

              Kramer enters.

              Kramer: These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) 
              Boy,
              these pretzels are making me thirsty.

              Jerry: Kramer.

              Kramer: What happened here?

              Elaine: I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called 
              an ambulance,
              does anyone know first aid?

              Jerry: Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?

              Elaine: What extremities?

              Kramer: What's an extremity?

              Jerry: You raise the feet, get blood to the head.

              Kramer: You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.

              Elaine: Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.

              Jerry: I don't have a washcloth.

              Elaine: Well use a paper towel.

              Jerry: You can't put a paper towel on his head.


              Kramer: What about a big sponge?

              Jerry: How you gonna hold it on there?

              Kramer: Use a belt.

              Elaine: No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.

              Jerry: Should we walk him around?

              Elaine and Kramer (at the same time): Yes, yes.

              Kramer: Yeah, I've seen them do that.

              Jerry: No, no that's for a drug overdose.

              Kramer: Maybe that's what he's got.

              Elaine: No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't 
              leave the
              table.

              Kramer: Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.

              Elaine: He is not a drug addict!

              Jerry: Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just 
              need a cookie
              or something.

              Elaine: A cookie!

              Kramer: Can you give him a cookie?

              Elaine: How's he gonna chew it?

              Jerry: We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar 
              revived him.

              Kramer puts a cookie into Owen's mouth and starts working his jaw 
              up and down.

              Elaine: Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.

              Kramer: I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.

              Elaine: You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and 
              he could drink
              it.

              Jerry: Cookies don't liquefy.

              Elaine: Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.

              Kramer: Alright I'll get a blender.

              Jerry: What blender? I don't have a blender.

              Kramer: You got a blender.

              Jerry: I would know if I had a blender.

              Elaine: Where is the ambulance?!

              Just then a siren can be heard followed by a skidding sound followed 
              by a
              crashing sound.

              The frame dissolves out and in as if to show time passing.

              Jerry (on phone): Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five
              minutes ago.

              Elaine: I can't believe what's going on out here.

              Jerry: This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer 
              buzzes) 
              Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?

              Voice: Paramedics.

              Jerry: Come on up. Okay, they're here.

              Elaine: He seems to be breathing.

              Jerry: Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.

              Elaine: I know.

              Jerry: Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that 
              to him?

              Elaine: Almost.

              Jerry: Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.

              Elaine: It's not an easy thing to bring up.

              Jerry: Yeah, that's true.

              Elaine: Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.

              Jerry: Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.

              Elaine: He does, how'd you know that?

              Jerry: I could tell.

              Two paramedics enter with a stretcher.

              Elaine: What happened, what took you so long?!

              Paramedic: We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, 
              the whole
              intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So 
              finally we
              make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars 
              slammed into
              us with a blue Escort.

              Jerry: Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!

              George enters, blotting his forehead with a washcloth.

              George: Oh man.

              Jerry: What happened to the car?

              George: Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks 
              at Owen) 
              Who's he?

              Elaine: This guy I'm seeing.

              George: What happened?

              Jerry: We don't know!

              Paramedic: Who put cookies in his mouth?

              Jerry and Elaine: Cookies?

              Paramedic: You're not supposed to do that.

              Jerry: So how'd you hit the car?

              George: I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw 
              Woody Allen
              and I got all distracted.

              Jerry: It's not even my car, it's a rental.

              Kramer enters.

              Kramer: What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production 
              of the
              movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.

              George: Woody mentioned me? What did he say?

              Kramer: He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the 
              street all
              screwed up?'

              George: Should I apologize to Woody?

              Kramer: Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe 
              I'll bring
              it up. I'll feel him out.


              Mid-episode Monologue.
              What do you think first aid was like though, like hundreds of years 
              ago? You
              know, I mean they had no medicine, no drugs, no technology, no equipment. 
              
              Basically, they were there first. That was it, that was the whole 
              first aid. 
              They sit with you. That's all they could do. 'Can you help me?' 
              'No, no we
              can't help you, we were the first ones here, I don't know if you 
              know that. Did
              you see out truck? First aid, that's our motto. We show up before 
              anybody.'


              New scene.
              Jerry, George and Sid are in Jerry's apartment. 

              Sid: Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should 
              have
              mentioned that.

              George: Well I know how to drive.

              Sid: Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling 
              me up
              screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.


              Jerry: Can I get anybody anything?

              Sid: Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't 
              take no more
              sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's 
              putting your
              pants on?

              George: I put my pants on, Sid.

              Sid: I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can 
              move those
              cars.

              George: Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.

              Sid: Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little 
              boy needs
              surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because 
              you can't
              park a few cars.

              George: Maybe I could call my father.

              Kramer enters holding a newspaper.

              Kramer: Hey, you seen the paper yet?

              Jerry: Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.

              Kramer: Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.

              Jerry (reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered 
              a stroke
              yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.

              Kramer: Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.

              Jerry (continuing): The extent of the damage would have been far 
              less severe
              had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.

              Sid: Oh lord.

              Jerry (finishing): The commotion also delayed production of a Woody 
              Allen movie
              that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary 
              filmmaker said
              that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of 
              shooting
              movies in New York were over.


              New scene.
              Elaine and Jerry are back at the car rental agency, Jerry's eating 
              a bag of
              pretzels.

              Elaine: Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking 
              up with
              him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's 
              over.'

              Jerry: Can he communicate?

              Elaine: Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems 
              to enjoy
              it when I read to him.

              Jerry: Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called 
              before,
              uh, my car got smashed.

              Elaine: So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him 
              now it'll
              look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized 
              from
              the community.

              Jerry: What community? There's a community?

              Elaine: Of course there's a community.

              Jerry: All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.

              Agent: Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand 
              eight hundred
              and sixty-six dollars.

              Jerry: Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...

              Agent: Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the 
              driver of
              the car at the time of the accident.

              Jerry: That is right, somebody else was driving.

              Agent: Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving 
              the car.

              Jerry: Uh huh, what's that?

              Agent: You're not covered for other drivers.

              Jerry: Other drivers?

              Agent: Um hm.

              Jerry: Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented 
              car. 
              That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover 
              me or
              something?

              Agent: Not that particular one.

              Jerry: Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, 
              any card you
              want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.

              Agent: Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--

              Jerry: Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration 
              of
              Independence, who's gonna read that?

              Agent: Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered 
              for that
              damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.

              Jerry: These pretzels are making me thirsty.


              New scene.
              Elaine and Owen are at Owen's apartment, Owen is in a wheelchair 
              and in
              generally unresponsive as Elaine feeds him soup.

              Elaine: Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, 
              huh? Don't
              they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in 
              the south, are
              they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my 
              Yankee
              Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) 
              Owen, I
              think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be 
              nice if *we*
              could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming 
              here, and uh,
              feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's 
              good stuff. 
              Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! 
              But at this
              point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment 
              to one
              person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. 
              For example, I
              like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and 
              skiing, and um,
              well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch 
              to get here. 
              It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take 
              the
              double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. 
              These
              pretzels are making me thirsty.


              New scene.
              Coffee shop. Elaine, Jerry and George are at their usual booth.

              Elaine: Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked 
              in a
              vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?

              Jerry: An overdose of odour? Good question.

              George: Do I smell?

              Elaine: No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street 
              subway today,
              it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.

              Jerry: Ahh.

              George: He's alright?

              Elaine: Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just 
              using me for
              sex.

              The waitress brings the check.

              Jerry: Let me get that.

              George: No no no, I got it.

              Jerry: Please.


              George: No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost 
              you over two
              thousand dollars, 

              Jerry: Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.

              Kramer enters and sits down.

              Jerry: What are you doing here?

              Kramer: I got fired from the movie.

              George: Get out of here, why?

              Kramer: Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we 
              rehearsed it
              twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These 
              pretzels
              are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I 
              slammed the
              glass down on the bar and it shattered.

              Elaine: Aww.

              Kramer: Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started 
              crying. And
              he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, 
              she came up
              to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.

              Kramer drops a pair of gloves on the table. Jerry picks up the gloves.

              Jerry: Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.


              Closing monologue.

              I think the best part of a relationship is when you're sick. And 
              the best part
              of being sick is when you're in a relationship. And if I was to 
              get married,
              you know all those vows; for richer or for poorer, for better or 
              for worse, all
              I need is the sickness. That, to me, is the most important one. 
              Do you take
              this man in sickness? That's the only time I need somebody there. 
              Rest of the
              time, go out, have a ball, do whatever you want, but if I get the 
              sniffles, you
              better be there.

              
              End. 
              
                                                
                         
        

        I tell ya, I never really understood the importance of the conductor. 
        I mean
        between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing? Do you really need
        somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin? Does that really 
        help
        you out? I could see how we need him at the beginning. Okay, tap-tap-tap,
        start. Okay, I can see how you need that. But once we're going, okay, 
        once
        it's all happening, what do we need him for then? I don't see the cellist
        looking up, go, "I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I don't know 
        what to
        do." And the conductor goes, "Do this. Like this" "Oh, 
        okay, thank you very
        much."


        First scene.
        Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant.

        George: Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna 
        meet
        anybody, I should just accept it.

        Jerry: Oh, yes you will.

        George: No, I won't.

        Jerry: Yeah, maybe you won't.

        George: I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less 
        like.

        Jerry: Are my nostrils getting bigger?

        George: No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension 
        and
        hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, 
        "Hi. I'm
        George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?

        Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers up a 
        meek 'Hi'
        which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' a few more 
        times
        as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though we was saying 
        that
        anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch than 
        read.)


        New scene.
        Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another restaurant.

        Cynthia: There's just no men out there, you know?

        Elaine: I know.

        Cynthia: I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And 
        they
        know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves
        to one person.

        Elaine: I hate the good ones.

        Cynthia: Is Jerry one of the good ones?

        Elaine: That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.

        Cynthia: Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure 
        about
        not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm 
        not good
        enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just 
        go, "You're
        right."

        Elaine: You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.

        Cynthia: No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just 
        has to
        appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.


        Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily.

        George: I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators 
        on
        the phone. I almost made a date with one.

        Jerry: Oh, so there's still hope.

        George: I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become
        hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, 
        that
        indifference makes you attractive.

        Jerry: Oh, so hopelessness is the key.

        George: It's my only hope.


        Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.

        Cynthia: See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my 
        mother. 
        I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling
        you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill 
        her
        because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through 
        that.

        Elaine: Well, at least you're not bitter.

        Cynthia: Who says I'm not bitter?

        Elaine: Aren't you too young to be bitter?

        Cynthia: No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as 
        I'm gonna
        be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.

        Elaine: Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.

        Cynthia: Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.


        New scene.
        Jerry and Elaine are reading the newspaper at Jerry's apartment.

        Jerry: Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should
        give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.

        Elaine: So what'd you do last night?

        Jerry: Went out with George, you?

        Elaine: Went out with Cynthia.

        Jerry: How was it? What'd you talk about?

        Elaine: Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. 
        
        Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it 
        in one
        fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. 
        What
        about you?

        Jerry: We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just 
        can't
        find anybody.

        Elaine: I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.

        Jerry: George too.


        They look at each other for a moment.

        Jerry and Elaine (together): Yeah, right.

        Jerry: I've never fixed anybody up.

        Elaine: Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.

        Jerry: Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good 
        for
        George?

        Elaine: I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?

        Jerry: Well you implied it.

        Elaine: I didn't say it.

        Jerry: Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. 
        
        Dead wrong. Who is she?

        Elaine: Who is he?

        Jerry: He's George!

        Elaine: She's Cynthia!

        Jerry: So what?

        Elaine: What, you don't think she's beautiful?

        Jerry: I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?

        Elaine: You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.

        Jerry: I went out with you.

        Elaine: That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know,
        women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck 
        their
        real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. 
        Bald
        above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.

        Jerry: Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can 
        run
        like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over 
        his
        head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, 
        but
        George can bait a hook.

        Elaine: He can really do that?

        Jerry: Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.

        Elaine: What, are you into this?

        Jerry: Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

        Elaine: No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us 
        how
        their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?

        Jerry: Naturally.

        Elaine: Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I 
        mean
        every secret?

        Jerry: Everything.

        Elaine: What if it worked out?

        Jerry (dialing): Yeah right.


        New scene.
        Jerry and George are in Jerry's apartment.

        George: Out of the question. Out of the question!

        Jerry: Why?

        George: No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal 
        ads! 
        And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she 
        look
        like?

        Jerry: She's good looking.

        George: How good looking?

        Jerry: Very good looking.

        George: Really good looking?

        Jerry: Really very good looking.

        George: Would you take her out?

        Jerry: Yes, I would take her out.

        George: Oh, you hesitated.

        Jerry: What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!

        George: No, something's off here, you hesitated.

        Jerry: I'm telling you, she's good looking.

        George: What about the body, what kind of body?

        Jerry: Good body, nice body.

        George: How nice?

        Jerry: Nice.

        George: Just nice?

        Jerry: Pretty nice.

        George: Really good?

        Jerry: Really very nice and good.

        George: What about personality?

        Jerry: Good personality. Funny. Bright.

        George: Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.

        Jerry: How could she be smarter than you?

        George: Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, 
        what
        does she do?


        New scene.
        Elaine and Cynthia are having a similar discussion.

        Cynthia: First of all, what does he do?

        Elaine: He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-

        Cynthia: He's not working?! How come he's not working?

        Elaine: Well, um, he, he got fired.

        Cynthia: Why did he get fired?

        Elaine: Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.

        Cynthia: Excuse me?

        Elaine: Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some 
        problems
        at work.

        Cynthia: Is he nuts?

        Elaine: No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.

        Cynthia: What does he look like?

        Elaine: Pardon?

        Cynthia: What does he look like?

        Elaine: Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. 
        
        Um, he's stocky.

        Cynthia: Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?

        Elaine: Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right 
        up
        over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's 
        kind
        of, just kind of losing his hair.

        Cynthia: He's bald?

        Elaine: No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.

        Cynthia: So he will be bald.

        Elaine: Yup.


        Cut back to Jerry and George.

        George: What kind of hair?

        Jerry: You know, long dark hair.


        George: Flowing?

        Jerry: Flowing?

        George: Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous 
        hair is
        very important to me.

        Jerry: 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you 
        said?

        George: Yeah, that's right.

        Jerry: Just clarifying.

        George: Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it 
        easy to
        get it out?

        Jerry: Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able 
        to
        get it out?

        George: I'd like to be able to get it out.

        Jerry: I think you'll get it out.

        George: What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.

        Jerry: She's got a fine cheek.

        George: Is there a pinkish hue?

        Jerry: A pinkish hue?

        George: Yes, a rosy glow.

        Jerry: There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her
        eyebrows.

        George: Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not 
        too
        sweet, you could throw up from that.

        Jerry: I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.


        Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.

        Cynthia: Has he ever been married?

        Elaine: No.

        Cynthia: Has he been close?

        Elaine: He once spent a weekend with a woman.

        Cynthia: He didn't really try to poison his boss?

        Elaine: Yeah, he did.


        New scene.
        The next day, George is back at Jerry's.

        George: We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty
        minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I 
        thought
        she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?

        Jerry: I think it's tamber.

        George: Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials,
        why didn't you tell me about her voice?

        Jerry: I didn't notice the voice.

        George: It's mellifluous!

        Jerry: So, Saturday night.

        George: She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a 
        great
        performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just 
        have
        two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.

        Elaine enters.

        Elaine: Hi.

        George: Hey! Saturday night!

        Elaine: I know!

        George: So, what did she say?

        Elaine: She said you're getting together Saturday night!

        George: That's it?

        Elaine: Yeah!

        George: She didn't mention anything about the conversation?

        Elaine: No.

        George: Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, 
        great
        conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?

        Elaine: What?

        Jerry: She could have mentioned the conversation.

        George: Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.

        Kramer enters.

        Kramer: Hey.

        Jerry: Hey.

        Kramer: You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?

        Jerry: Oh, the guy from Jersey?

        Kramer: Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at 
        this,
        he gave me a gross.

        George: What are you gonna do with all of them?

        Kramer: Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.

        Jerry: No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.

        Kramer: Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.

        Elaine: Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.

        George: I'll take one. It's possible.


        Mid-episode monologue.

        The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we should have 
        like a
        secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, 
        you go up
        to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) he puts 
        them in
        the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little shaving
        cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" 
        (nods) "Have a
        nice day." "You too."


        New scene.
        Elaine and Jerry are on the phone, waiting for George and Cynthia's date 
        to end.

        Jerry: So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should 
        be back
        by now, what did they do?

        Elaine: I think they went out to dinner.

        Jerry: Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?

        George: Yeah, it's me, I just got home.

        Jerry: Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.

        Elaine: Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.

        Jerry: Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.

        Elaine: Remember our pact. Full disclosure.

        Jerry: Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.

        George: Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, 
        we
        swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.

        Jerry: You can tell me, I'll vault it.

        George: It's in the vault?

        Jerry: I'm locking the vault. What?

        George: We had sex.

        Jerry: Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?

        George: I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.

        Jerry: At your apartment?


        George: Yeah.

        Jerry: She didn't stay over?

        George: No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. 
        
        Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.

        Cut to Elaine on the phone with Cynthia.

        Elaine: Oh my god.

        Cynthia: He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt 
        he would
        perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always 
        the
        most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.

        Elaine: So? How was it?

        Cynthia: How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.

        Elaine: Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.

        Cynthia: Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.

        Elaine: Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?

        Jerry: So, what did she have to say?

        Elaine: What did he have to say?

        Jerry: He said they had a good time.

        Elaine: Her too.

        Jerry: Oh, good.

        Elaine: Anything else?

        Jerry: Nope. You?

        Elaine: Nope.

        Jerry: You sure?

        Elaine: Yup. You?

        Jerry: Yeah.

        Elaine: Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.

        Jerry: Yeah. Okay then.

        Elaine: Alright. Goodnight.

        Jerry: Goodnight.


        New scene.
        Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment.

        George: I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex 
        with
        me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind 
        of a
        person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.

        Jerry: Well, I'm gonna do something about this.

        George: What are you gonna do?

        Jerry: Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen 
        floor
        like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. 
        
        She's not going to get away with this.

        George: I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was
        smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could 
        see I
        could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.

        Jerry: I'm gonna call her.

        George: No, don't call her.

        Jerry: No, I'm calling her.

        George: No, Jerry, don't call.

        Jerry: No, forget it, I'm gonna call.

        George: I don't want you to call.

        Jerry: Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.

        George: Give me the phone!

        Jerry: George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?

        George: Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!

        Kramer enters and gets between them to break up the fight.

        Kramer: Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!

        Jerry: I'll just call her when you leave!

        George: You can't do that, it's none of your business!

        Jerry: It is so my business!

        Kramer: Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one 
        of
        you!


        George: But tell him to give me the--

        Kramer: Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says
        something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what 
        this
        is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?

        George: No.

        Jerry: Yeah, but--

        Kramer: Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. 
        They
        play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.

        Jerry: But Kramer--

        Kramer: Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are
        plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.

        Jerry and George shake hands.

        Kramer: Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean,
        you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, 
        you
        know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.

        George: What?

        Kramer: Right.

        George: Defective?!

        Kramer: Defective.

        George (attacking Kramer): How could you give me a defective condom?!

        Kramer: I didn't even know they were defective.

        Jerry gets between them to break up the fight.

        Kramer: Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.

        George: What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!

        Jerry: Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, 
        if
        anything was wrong she would have called you already!


        New scene.
        Elaine answers her door, it's Cynthia.

        Cynthia: I missed my period.

        Elaine: Oh my god.

        Cynthia: I am very worried, I am never late.

        Elaine: But he used a condom, right?

        Cynthia: I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.

        Elaine: Oh no.

        Cynthia: What?

        Elaine: Was it blue?

        Cynthia: Yeah. How'd you know?

        Elaine: Just a hunch.


        New scene.
        Jerry is in his apartment trying to open a bottle of soda.

        Jerry: Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!

        Elaine walks in and give him a funny look.

        Jerry: Oh, hi. Soda?


        Elaine: No thanks.

        Jerry: So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She
        doesn't return calls?

        Elaine: Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when 
        she's
        good and ready. You don't even know her.

        Jerry: Oh, I know her. I know her type.

        Elaine: Her type? What type?

        Jerry: The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have 
        done
        this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!

        Elaine: You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!

        Jerry: I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.

        Elaine: She's not bitter!

        Jerry: Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!

        Elaine: Twisted? God, I did you a favor.

        Jerry: I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else 
        you're
        keeping from me?

        Elaine: Are you calling me a liar?

        Jerry: I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?

        Elaine: Are you?

        Jerry: Get your finger out of my face.

        Elaine: You get yours out, I was here first!

        Jerry: I don't care.

        Elaine: Get it out!

        Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap fight, 
        and gets
        in the middle.

        Kramer: Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's 
        the
        matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? 
        I
        mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there 
        looking
        for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of 
        is right
        here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the 
        way,
        when you see George give him these, these'll work.

        Elaine: I knew those condoms were defective!

        Jerry: How did you know they were defective?!

        George walks in.

        Elaine: Because! Because she missed her period!

        George: She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! 
        
        I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!

        George rushes out, hysterical.


        New scene.
        Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant.

        Cynthia: So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And 
        he
        tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him 
        and
        that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in 
        whatever
        way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.

        Elaine: Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.

        Cynthia: I said to him, "I really appreciate this, but I just got 
        my period." 
        And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--

        George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping.

        Elaine: Hi!

        George: Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.

        Elaine: What happened?

        Jerry: Acting.

        Elaine: Very mature.

        Jerry: Thank you. Hi Cynthia.

        Cynthia: Hi.

        Jerry: Well this is a great place to sit you got here.

        Cynthia: Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the
        kitchen.

        George (hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin): Stop it, stop it.

        Jerry: So what are these?

        Elaine: Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.

        George stars eating like a slob, Cynthia looks at him funny. You get the 
        idea
        that the relationship has just ended.

        George (with a mouth full of food): This is good. Oh, this is good.


        Closing monologue.

        Have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they 
        would
        have a good time. And a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now, you're
        playing god. Of course god was the first person to fix people up. He fixed 
        up
        Adam and Eve. You know, I'm sure he said to Adam, "She's nice. She's 
        very free
        about her body, doesn't really wear that much. She was going out with 
        a snake,
        I think that's over though."

              =========
              To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're
              working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but 
              the
              strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. 
              The only
              reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through 
              the
              workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when 
              we have
              to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't 
              get
              about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels 
              and
              smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting 
              gym
              clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt 
              because he
              has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even 
              think
              about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these 
              locks
              you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff 
              is safe.


              [Gym Locker Room]

              KRAMER: Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches 
              on that
              guy. You two were hogging the ball.

              GEORGE: Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is 
              dribble.

              JERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're 
              a
              chucker.

              GEORGE: Oh I'm a chucker.

              JERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.

              GEORGE: I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, 
              I do
              not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, 
              no chuck!

              JERRY: You chuck.

              GEROGE: Kramer am I a chucker?


              KRAMER: You're a chucker.

              GEORGE: All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told 
              me?

              JERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.

              KRAMER: Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each 
              other naked. 

              JERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything. 

              KRAMER: Oh, you didn't sneak a peak? 

              JERRY: No, did you?

              KRAMER: Yeah, I snuck a peak. 

              JERRY: Why?

              KRAMER: Why not? hey what about you George? 

              GEORGE: yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't 
              see 
              anything. It was just a blur.

              JERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information 
              I just 
              don't want to have. 

              KRAMER: Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.

              JERRY: All right 

              KRAMER: Have a good one.

              JERRY: All right

              GEORGE: See ya.

              [Kramer exits]

              GEORGE: look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?

              JERRY: You know who that is? That's 

              GEORGE: Keith Hernandez? The baseball player? 

              JERRY: Yeah, that's him. 

              GEORGE: Are you sure? 

              JERRY: Positive. 

              GEORGE: Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.

              JERRY: Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff. 

              GEORGE: I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to 
              do to be a buff

              JERRY: So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 
              hours a day 
              would be a start. 

              GEORGE: ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. 
              I got 
              to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension 

              JERRY: Hey, should we say something to him? 

              GEORGE: Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker 
              room.

              JERRY: well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind. 

              GEORGE: He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld. 

              JERRY: So? 

              GEORGE: What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The 
              guys a baseball 
              player Jerry, Baseball!

              JERRY: I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice 
              him. 

              GEORGE: What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... 
              wo wo wo. 
              The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.

              KEITH: Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez 
              and I just 
              want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy. 

              JERRY: Really?

              KEITH: I've always wanted to do what you do. 

              JERRY: What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all 
              time 

              GEORGE: Mine too.

              KEITH: I love that bit about Jimmy Olson

              JERRY: Thank you.


              GEORGE: You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these 
              ball clubs 
              flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane 
              crash? ...

              KEITH: (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now? 
              

              JERRY: I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should 
              come in.

              GEORGE: But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, 
              you'd think 
              eventually an entire team would get wiped out.

              KEITH: You know, I live on the East Side. 

              JERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just 
              give me a call, 
              tell me whenever you want to go.

              KEITH: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee

              JERRY: Oh. that would be great. 

              GEORGE: Uh, it's only a matter of time. 

              KEITH: Who's this chucker?

              ---

              [Monks]

              JERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called. 

              ELAINE: Well maybe you should call him.

              JERRY: I can't ... I can't 

              ELAINE: Why not?

              JERRY: I don't know. I just feel he should call me. 

              ELAINE: What's the difference?

              JERRY: You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. 
              If he wants 
              to see me he has my number, he should call. 

              ELAINE: Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes. 

              JERRY: I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and 
              then they 
              don't call. Why do they do that?

              ELAINE: I'm sorry honey. 

              JERRY: I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked 
              me. we were 
              getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.

              ELAINE: No, 

              JERRY: Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? 

              ELAINE: I know.

              JERRY: What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? 
              I mean here I 
              meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever 
              met in my life. 
              .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy 
              again. 

              ELAINE: Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes 
              them a month to 
              call.

              JERRY: Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got 
              a prayer!

              ELAINE: You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town? 
              

              JERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people 
              say they're 
              too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How 
              can you be 
              too busy?

              ELAINE: Why don't you just go ahead and call him? 

              JERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going 
              to say to 
              him? 

              ELAINE: Just ask him if he wants a to get together.

              JERRY: For what dinner? 

              ELAINE: Dinner's good.

              JERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. 
              Isn't that like 
              a turn off?

              ELAINE: Jerry, He's A GUY! 

              JERRY: ... this is all .. very confusing.

              in 
              seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't 
              know the food. 
              They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the 
              gym or 
              someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have a 
              lot of 
              potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when you're 
              a kid, 
              you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little 
              kid what were 
              the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's 
              my friend, 
              they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come

              the babi...

              anymore 
              then you wouldn't have to see it.

              JERRY: uh uh because then it would be all grown up.

              NEWMAN: I despise him.

              ELAINE: Why?

              NEWMAN: Why? I'll tell you why...

              KRAMER: Let me tell it ..

              NEWMAN: No, you can't tell it ..

              KRAMER: You always tell it ..

              NEWMAN: All right, tell it.

              KRAMER: Ja ja ja - just tell it 

              NEWMAN: June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful 
              afternoon 
              in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five 
              run Phillies 
              ninth. Cost the Mets the game.

              KRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, 
              they were 
              waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp 
              ... [cut 
              to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella 
              man and 
              everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front 
              of me. Keith 
              was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " 
              Nice game pretty 
              boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.

              NEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a 
              deep and 
              profound way front that day forward.

              ELAINE: What was it?

              KRAMER: He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"

              NEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me. 
              

              ELAINE: Wow! What a story.

              JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the 
              whole premise 
              of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss 

              Benes as 
              I've heard this story a number of times.

              JERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story 
              Keith 
              passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were 
              struck on 
              the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple 
              
              striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam 
              off 
              the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to 
              drop his 
              baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid 
              air 
              mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That 
              is one 
              magic luggie.

              [THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF KEVIN 
              COSTNER'S COURTROOM SCENE IN 
              THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!]

              NEWMAN: Well that's the way it happened.

              JERRY: What happened to your head when you got hit?

              KRAMER: Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left

              JERRY: Again

              KRAMER: Back and to the left

              JERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left

              ELAINE: So, what are you saying?

              JERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind 
              ... that there had to have been 
              a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the 
              spitter was behind you as you claimed 
              that would have caused your head to pitch forward.

              ELAINE: So the spit could have only come from the front and to the 
              right.

              JERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.

              NEWMAN: I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. [Exits] 

              KRAMER: Wait, wait, [Exits]

              JERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth. 

              [George runs in]

              GEORGE: [Frantically] Did anybody call here asking for Vandaley 
              industries?

              JERRY: No. What happened to you?

              GEORGE: Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and 
              I told them that I was very close 
              to getting a job with Vandaley Industries and I gave them your phone 
              number. So, when now when the phone 
              rings you've got to answer "Vanadaley Industries".

              JERRY: I'm Vanadaley Industries?

              GEORGE: Right.

              JERRY: And what is that?

              GEORGE: You're in latex

              JERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex? 

              GEORGE: Ya manufacture it.

              ELAINE: Here in this little apartment?

              JERRY: And what do I say about you?

              GEORGE: You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.

              JERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman? 

              GEORGE: Right.

              JERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?

              GEORGE: Because I asked you to.

              JERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk 
              pushing papers 
              around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to 
              
              manufacture the stuff.

        Chicago.Jerry: He's definitely in Chicago.

        George: Well the guy's just standing there.

        Jerry: How would we do it?

        George: We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."

        Jerry: Maybe he knows O'Brien?

        George: No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have 
        a
        sign. Let's just do it.

        Jerry: What if we get caught?

        George: What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.

        Jerry: Who's gonna be O'Brien?

        George: I'll be O'Brien.

        Jerry: Who am I?

        George: You're you.

        Jerry: Just me?

        George: Yeah.

        Jerry: Okay.

        George: What, you don't want to be you?

        Jerry: Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?

        George: Like who?

        Jerry: Dylan Murphy.

        George mumbles something.

        Jerry: What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?

        George: Well I like Dylan.

        Jerry: You could be Colin.

        George: Colin O'Brien.

        Jerry: I'm Dylan Murphy.

        George: I'm Colin O'Brien.

        They walk towards the chauffer.

        George: Are we really doing this?

        Jerry: Come on,

        Man (to George): Hey, do you have the time?

        George: Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.

        Chauffer: Yes sir.

        George: Sorry we're late.

        Chauffer: Here let me take that for you.

        George: Oh thank you.

        Chauffer: I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.

        George: Thank you very much. Dylan?

        Jerry: Colin?


        New scene.
        George and Jerry are in the back of a limo. George is giddy with excitement.

        George: This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever 
        done
        in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.

        Jerry: What for?

        George: I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where 
        I am. 
        In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell 
        you

        now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop
        it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? 
        I'm
        *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!

        Jerry: She happy for you?

        George: Can he hear us?

        Jerry: No. Why?

        George: I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.

        Jerry: He can't hear us.

        George: Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick 
        up
        your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.

        Jerry: Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at 
        my
        house?

        George: We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you
        dropping us?

        Chauffer: Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.

        George: Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes 
        to
        Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! 
        
        The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!

        Jerry: What?

        George: We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!

        Jerry: We're going to the Knick game!

        George: Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!

        Jerry: I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!

        George: You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, 
        wait,
        you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do 
        you see
        things as they are? What do you say when you see things?

        Jerry: Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.

        George: If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'

        Jerry: Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and 
        I
        have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square 
        Garden. 
        Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner 
        at
        seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right
        babydoll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. 
        I
        can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens
        partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.

        Chauffer: I know.

        Jerry and George: He knows?

        George: Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?

        Jerry: Maybe it's a shortcut.

        George: We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.

        Jerry: (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this 
        exit?

        Chauffer: Pick up the other members of your party.

        George: Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other
        members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know 
        we
        were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.

        Jerry: It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this 
        jig.

        George: It was a good jig.

        Jerry: It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do 
        now? 
        They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.

        George: There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a 
        limo.

        Jerry: First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.

        George: Well you should have been O'Brien.

        Jerry: I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?

        George: Yes, you have to be Murphy.

        Jerry: It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.

        George: You're Murphy!

        Jerry: I'm Seinfeld!

        George: You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.

        Jerry: We're doing sixty miles an hour!

        George: So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.

        Jerry: Who are you, Mannix?

        George: We're slowing down. Are those the people?

        Jerry: Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.

        The limo pulls over, two people, a man (Tim) and a woman (Eva), get in.

        Woman (reaches out to Jerry): Mr. O'Brien?

        Jerry: No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.

        Eva (whispering): Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather
        excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his
        newsletter.

        Jerry: Newsletter?

        Tim: And of course, his great book, "The Game".

        Jerry: Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've 
        never
        uh, met him before?

        Eva: No.

        Jerry: Never seen a picture of him?

        Eva: Never.

        Jerry: Not even on the book jacket?

        Eva: There was no picture on the book jacket.

        Jerry (nudging George): Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake 
        up.

        George: Hello. I'm O'Brien.


        New scene.
        Elaine meets Kramer of Jerry's corner.

        Kramer: Hey!

        Elaine: Hey!

        Kramer: What, you took a cab?

        Elaine: Yeah? So?

        Kramer: How much do you make?

        Elaine: I'm not telling you.

        Kramer: C'mon.

        Elaine: No!

        Kramer: I'll tell you how much I make.

        Elaine: I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, 
        I
        don't even like basketball.

        Kramer: You ever seen Michael Jordan?

        Elaine: Just in those commercials.

        Kramer: Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.

        Elaine: What's that?

        Kramer: Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.

        Elaine: Huh?

        Kramer: Yeah.

        Kramer then drives to 'the hoop' and tumbles headfirst into a bunch of 
        garbage
        cans.



        Cut back to 'O'Brien' and 'Murphy' in the limo.

        Jerry (checking his watch): I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.

        Tim: You think someone's been tipped off?

        George: So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?

        Eva (fawning): Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.

        George: Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman
        thinks of "The Big Game".

        Eva: Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The 
        way you
        analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left 
        me
        breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.

        George: Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.

        Tim: Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the
        epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.

        George: Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.

        Jerry: He tends to exaggerate.

        George: Okay, I mean it's serious but--

        Eva: We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.

        George: Uh, my speech?

        Eva: Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it 
        over?

        Jerry: Well you might as well look it over.


        Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner.

        Kramer: So what's going on, how did all this happen?

        Elaine: Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're 
        all going
        to the Knicks-Bulls game.

        Kramer: Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.

        Elaine: He did.

        Kramer: Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?

        Elaine: I don't know.

        Kramer: That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?

        Elaine: Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call 
        them
        O'Brien and Murphy.

        Kramer: O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?


        Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech.

        George: ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied
        government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white
        minority communities.

        Jerry: You're not going to open with that, are you?

        Eva: What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?

        George: I said so many things.

        Suddenly they hear a loud bang.

        George: They're shooting! They're shooting!

        Tim (pulling out a gun): Alright, get down!

        The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look around, 
        Eva has
        fallen on top of George.

        Eva. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.

        George: That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.

        Eva: But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.

        Tim returns.

        Tim: Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, 
        we're
        prepared to handle anything that might come up.

        Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and starts handling
        it sensually.

        Jerry: Nice looking Lugar.


        New scene.
        Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.

        Jodi: I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square 
        Garden
        where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering 
        to
        protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader 
        of the
        midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their 
        most
        charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the 
        violent
        overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration 
        of Adolf
        Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There 
        is a
        full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell 
        me he is
        in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, 
        but
        quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional
        fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm 
        Jodi
        Baskerville, back to you in the studio.


        Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner.

        Kramer: Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up 
        Jerry. 
        They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and 
        wanna be
        called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?

        A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of them recognized
        Elaine.

        Dan: Elaine?

        Elaine: Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?

        Dan: Good.

        Elaine: Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.

        Dan: Oh, Kramer?

        They shake hands.

        Elaine: What's going on?

        Dan: Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head 
        of
        the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.

        Elaine: Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.

        Dan: Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.

        Elaine: Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.

        Dan: Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first 
        time
        he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.

        Kramer: Who?

        Dan: The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.


        Cut back to the limo.
        Jerry and George are alone inside.

        Jerry: What's taking him so long out there?

        George: Didja see the way she was looking at me?

        Jerry: She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!

        George: I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.

        Jerry: Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna 
        do?

        George: I don't know.

        Jerry: Let's just make a run for it.

        George: I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.

        Jerry: How'd that happen?


        George: I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers 
        in real
        tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick 
        it out
        and I pulled it.

        Jerry: I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with 
        your
        feet like that.

        George: For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the 
        police.

        George grabs the phone and dials.

        George: 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah
        listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--

        Tim re-enters the limo.

        George: --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! 
        The
        Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.

        Tim: We'll be ready in a minute.

        George: Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the 
        middle
        of something.

        Tim: With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.

        George: Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?

        Tim: You are.

        George: And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular
        again?

        Tim: You are.

        George: Good. I think you forgot something.

        Tim: I'm sorry.

        George: Good. Now get out.

        Tim leaves.

        George: Okay, what are we gonna do?

        Jerry: I don't know.

        George: Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, 
        we see
        Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.

        Jerry: Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.


        Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner.

        Kramer: I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.

        Elaine: I'm sure he was just joking around.

        Kramer: Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago,
        Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. 
        Yes!

        Elaine: What is it?

        Kramer: Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about 
        Jerry,
        always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The 
        limo? 
        The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same
        person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!

        Elaine: Jerry's a nazi?!

        Kramer: I can't believe I didn't see it.

        Elaine: Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.

        Kramer: You don't think so.

        Elaine: No, he's just neat.


        Cut back to the limo.

        Tim: You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.

        George: Me??

        George and Jerry laugh nervously.

        Tim: And you really don't look like a Murphy.

        Jerry: I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.

        George: He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.

        Tim: Where are you from?

        Jerry: Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. 
        
        Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country
        though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.

        Tim: Sounds more like Scottish.

        Jerry: We were right on the border.


        Cut back to the street corner.

        Kramer: Maybe he's with the company.

        Elaine: What?

        Kramer: The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization
        from within.

        Elaine: What about his comedy act?

        Kramer: That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, 
        he's
        too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.

        Elaine: What about George?

        Kramer: What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. 
        
        No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're 
        with
        the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and 
        Hunt
        and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who 
        killed
        Kennedy!

        Elaine: I'll bet they were even in on it.

        Kramer: Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. 
        (grabs
        and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.

        Elaine: Kramer, you're hurting me!


        Quick cut to the now approaching limo.

        George: Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk 
        to
        them, pull over.

        Elaine: Get off of me!!

        The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out.

        Kramer: O'Brien.

        This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at a nearby 
        bus
        stop.

        Man: O'Brien? Is that him?

        Man #2: Yeah, that's him.

        Man #3: Look there's O'Brien!

        Man #4: Filthy nazi bastard!

        All four: Let's get him!!

        They begin running full speed towards the gang.

        George: What do I do?! What do I do?!

        Jerry: Get in the car! Get in the car!

        George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which speeds off.

        Kramer (pointing to Jerry): O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?

        Tim: Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?

        Jerry: No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.

        Elaine: It could be very confusing.

        The limo phone rings Kramer answers it.

        Kramer: Yeah? Eva?

        Eva: It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.


        Kramer: O'Brien? Well that's weird.

        Eva (gun drawn): Who are you?

        George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's car 
        broke
        down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.


        Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.

        Jodi: A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group 
        of
        protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.

        Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of 
        the three
        are intelligible at this point.

        Jodi: They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police 
        seem
        unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien 
        must be
        having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first 
        public
        appearance.

        Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less
        understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming
        unnerved.

        Eva: Get out!!

        Elaine: Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!

        Dan: Elaine?

        Elaine: Hey!


        Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic says 'DONALD
        O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'.

        George: I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! 
        
        Jerry?! Jerry?!!


        Closing monologue.

        So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World War Two movie 
        and
        there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in those movies 
        always
        had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that they 
        would do
        and then when they were around the offices they had like this casual heil,
        remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, heil, how 
        are ya,
        is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished with the 
        copier? 
        Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, heil, 
        nice
        to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Jerry is driving alone talking on his car phone to Elaine at home in 
        her 
        bed)
        Elaine: You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use 
        the 
        speaker?

        Jerry: It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.

        (Driver cuts in front of Jerry)
        Jerry: Oh look at this guy.

        Elaine: What's goin' on?

        Jerry: Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask 
        permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.

        Elaine: Did you get a thank you wave?

        Jerry: No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! 
        
        Where's my thank you wave?

        (Jerry sticks his head out the window)
        Jerry: Give me that wave!

        Elaine: Jerry, are you free on Friday?

        Jerry: Yeah, I'm free, why?

        Elaine: Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have 
        
        dinner with her and her husband.

        Jerry: Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed 
        into 
        a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!

        Elaine: You gotta follow that car!

        Jerry: What?!  

        Elaine: You can't let him get away with that!

        Jerry: Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.

        Elaine: What are you, yellow?

        Jerry: I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)

        Elaine: Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.

        Jerry: Wait, he stopped, he's parking.

        Elaine: What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?

        (Scene moves outside where Jerry get out of his car to confront other 
        
        driver, who as they come out of their car, is an attractive woman)
        Jerry: Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks 
        
        back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed 
        
        that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance 
        
        of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion 
        
        steering. (They both smile flirtatiously at each other)

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry and George are talking by 
        the 
        table)
        Jerry: So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.

        George: Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.

        Jerry: You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she 
        
        left, she reached out and touched my arm.

        (Reaches out to touch Georges arm to demonstrate)
        Jerry: He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)

        George: I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why 
        is 
        that?

        Jerry: Let's not even analyze it.

        (Jerry begins walking towards door)
        George: So you didn't turn her in?

        Jerry: I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.

        George: Gonna see her again?

        Jerry: Friday night.

        (Intercom buzzes, Jerry presses the button)
        Jerry: Yep.

        Elaine: It's me!

        Jerry: Come on up.

        (Jerry unlocks and opens door)
        Jerry: By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.

        George: Hey, hey, hey! I dig.

        (George walks into kitchen and opens cupboard to get cups)
        Jerry: Oh, you dig?

        George: Yes! I see enormous potential here.

        Jerry: Why?

        (George pours two cups of milk)
        George: Because great couples always have a great story about how they 
        met. 
        That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had 
        a 
        good meeting story.

        Jerry: I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.

        George: I don't think so.

        Jerry: Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility 
        for 
        mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!

        (Jerry takes a drink of his milk while both remain silent)
        Jerry: On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to 
        date 
        again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact 
        for 
        the rest of your life?!

        (Jerry looks at his cup in disgust)
        Jerry: What am I drinking, milk?

        (Elaine enters, hanging up her jacket)
        Elaine: Hey!

        Jerry: Hi.

        (Elaine tosses a sweater to Jerry)
        Elaine: Sweater.

        Jerry: Thank you.

        Elaine: So? What happened?

        (Jerry starts walking away)

        Jerry: With that?

        Elaine: With the car!

        Jerry: What car?

        Elaine: The hit and run!

        Jerry: Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and 
        run. 
        Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.

        Elaine: Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?

        Jerry: Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)

        (George walks out of the kitchen)
        George: Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.

        Jerry: Yeah, Queens.

        Elaine: So? Then what?

        Jerry: So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit 
        that 
        car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"

        (Elaine gasps)
        Jerry: So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."

        (Elaine stutters with her mouth open in amazement)
        Elaine: I am speechless. I am without speech.

        George: Tell her about the shoving.

        Jerry: What?

        (George smiles pointing at him)
        Elaine: What shoving?!

        Jerry: Oh, it was nothing.

        George: No! Tell her.

        (Jerry looks at George with a grin)
        Jerry: Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against 
        the 
        car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and 
        does 
        two punches)

        Elaine: You know karate??

        Jerry: I know a little.

        Elaine: Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?

        Jerry: He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.

        (Kramer enters)
        Kramer: Hey! (Group does likewise)

        Elaine: Did you tell Kramer?

        Jerry: Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)

        Kramer: What? What? What? Tell me.

        Elaine: Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.

        (Jerry looks at Kramer and raises both his arms smiling)
        Kramer: Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like 
        
        that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing 
        
        a finger at Jerry)

        Kramer: They should be sent to Australia.

        (Jerry has a confused look)
        Jerry: Australia?

        Kramer: Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.

        Jerry: But not anymore.

        Kramer: No.

        (Everyone pauses and looks at Kramer)
        Elaine: Hey Kramer, Kramer!

        Kramer: Yeah?

        Elaine: What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)

        Kramer: I don't know!

        (Jerry smiles and shakes his head)
        Kramer: You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly 
        I 
        got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.

        (Elaine has a look of surprise)
        Elaine: Well, that is, that is strange.

        Kramer: Yep. (Mumbles off)

        (Elaine walks toward door)
        Elaine: Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?

        Jerry: Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.

        (Elaine closes door and walks back toward Jerry)
        Elaine: But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)

        Jerry: We just met.

        (Kramer is tapping his temple with his finger)
        Kramer: Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.

        Elaine: But I, I can't go alone!

        Jerry: Ask George to go with you.

        Elaine: George, come on! I'll pay for you.

        George: You'll pay? I'm there.

        Jerry: Why do you even need anybody?

        Elaine: Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. 
        
        Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're 
        
        always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. 
        
        You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing 
        
        the door to leave)

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves to restaurant with Elaine, George, and the married couple, 
        
        Michael and Robin, sitting down talking, George is mainly focused on eating 
        
        his meal)
        Robin: You went out with a bullfighter?

        Elaine: Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.

        Michael: Wow.

        Robin: What was his name?

        Elaine: His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.

        (George points across the table)
        George: Pass the salt please.

        Robin: Where did you meet him?

        Elaine: Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, 
        is 
        that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the 
        
        bull, they avoid fighting the bull.

        (Elaine and couple laugh, George points at the bread)
        George: Bread.

        (Elaine hands bread to George)
        Elaine: I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really 
        do 
        learn about life.

        (Robin sneezes, no one says anything, George lifts his head and looks 
        at 
        Michael)
        George: God bless you.

        (Robin smiles)
        Robin: Thank you.

        George: I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't 
        
        going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)

        (Michael stops pouring wine and looks seriously at George)

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves to Jerry's car, where Jerry and hit-and-run woman are both 
        
        eating an ice cream cones)
        Woman: You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.

        Jerry: Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not 
        a very 
        good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.


        Woman: Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?

        Jerry: Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when 
        he 
        left a note after smacking into a car.

        (Woman touches Jerry's hair, smiling)
        Woman: Come here.

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves back to restaurant where an argument has developed between 
        
        Michael and George)
        George: Really, I was, I was only kidding around.

        Robin: He was only joking Michael.

        (Michael throws down his serviette)
        Michael: You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?

        George: No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not 
        
        special.

        Robin: He was only joking Michael! Sorry.

        Michael: All right! Take his side!

        Robin: I am not taking his side.

        Michael: Well who's side are you taking?!

        Robin: Well I'm not taking your side!

        (Robin sneezes, George gestures to Michael that the floor is his)

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves back to Jerry's car, where Jerry and the hit-and-run woman 
        are 
        now kissing)
        Jerry: Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such 
        an 
        unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. 
        
        He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can 
        
        exchange license, registration, and apologize.

        (Woman pulls Jerry back in and starts kissing him again)

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves back to Jerry apartment with George talking outside Jerry 
        room, 
        where Jerry is)
        George: I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?

        Jerry: The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come 
        in 
        with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to 
        first 
        refusal.

        (George makes a confused look. The intercom buzzes, Jerry walks over and 
        
        presses the button)
        Elaine: It's me.

        Jerry: Come on up.

        (Jerry unlocks door, conversation moves into kitchen)
        George: Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes 
        
        on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.

        Jerry: No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and 
        he's 
        holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.

        George: Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed 
        
        again later, and it was also a single.

        Jerry: What if she's having an off night?

        (Elaine walks in, Jerry goes to sit down on sofa)
        Elaine: Hi!

        Jerry. Hi.

        (Elaine takes her coat off and walks into kitchen)
        Elaine: Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!

        (George walks out of kitchen)
        George: Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. 
        I 
        was raised to say 'God bless you'.

        (Jerry sneezes)
        George: Ah, shut up.

        Elaine: What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 
        'stuperstition'.

        (Elaine sits on sofa, George sits on arm of sofa)
        Jerry: A stupid what?

        (Elaine looks at Jerry)
        Elaine: Whatever.

        Jerry: You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, 
        
        you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good 
        lookin''.

        (Elaine nods, George rolls his eyes)
        Elaine: Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left 
        a 
        message on my machine, she wants you to call her.

        George: Who?

        Elaine: Robin!

        (George looks quickly at Elaine)
        George: Why?!

        Elaine: Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called 
        me.

        (George stands up)
        Jerry: Entertainment Tonight's on.

        George: Where's the remote phone?

        Jerry: Bedroom.

        (George walks toward Jerry's bedroom)
        Elaine: Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?

        (Theme music plays on TV, Kramer walks in, waves at Jerry and Elaine, 
        then 
        walks over to Jerry's bookshelf, dancing to the music. Voice of Mary Hart 
        
        starts on TV and Kramer starts having a wild seizure behind the sofa.)
        Jerry: What's it like out?

        (Kramer continues to shake behind sofa)
        Elaine: Chilly out.

        Jerry: Can I take a sweater?

        Elaine: Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.

        Jerry: Scarf?

        Elaine: Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.

        (Jerry and Elaine finally notice Kramer as he finishes)
        Jerry: What's the matter? What's going on?

        (Kramer is looking around like he's lost)
        Kramer: What happened?!

        Elaine: What?

        Kramer: I think I hit my head again!

        Jerry: What is wrong?!

        (Elaine is pointing at the TV)
        Elaine: Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the 
        last 
        time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?

        Kramer: Yeah.

        (Elaine claps her hands together then stands up)
        Elaine: That is it!

        Kramer: What?

        (Elaine walks toward Kramer pointing her finger at him)
        Elaine: That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something 
        
        about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, 
        
        just like that woman in Albany!

        (George walks out of Jerry's bedroom toward kitchen, Kramer sits down)
        Kramer: Mary Hart!

        George: God.

        Elaine: What?

        George: Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get 


        together Wednesday afternoon.

        Jerry: Get together?

        George: Maybe she just wants to talk to me?

        Elaine: Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.

        (George walks to other side of sofa)
        George: Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings 
        and 
        martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost 
        me 
        any money.

        (George sits on chair)
        Elaine: Are you actually considering this?

        George: I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!

        Elaine: Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving 
        a 
        note.

        (Jerry moves around sofa as if uncomfortable)
        Jerry: Yeah.

        (Kramer walks out of washroom)
        Kramer: Hey, you know who owns that car?

        Jerry: What car?

        Kramer: The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.

        Jerry: Yeah who?

        Kramer: That blond across the street. You know the one with the long 
        ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.

        (Jerry stands up and walks toward kitchen)
        Jerry: The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.

        (Elaine nods, smiling)
        Elaine: Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.

        (Elaine walks out door, Kramer follows)
        Kramer: Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?

        (Jerry closes door behind them, then runs over to George very excited)
        Jerry: The blond with the blue sweatpants!

        George: Well, who is she?

        Jerry: I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid 
        to 
        approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.

        George: Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't 
        
        say anything because of Angela.

        (Jerry sits down, disgruntled, flips aimlessly through a magazine)
        Jerry: Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick 
        person 
        does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually 
        
        owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow 
        this 
        to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!

        (Jerry and George are both pointing their fingers at each other)
        George: You can't compromise your principles!

        Jerry: How am I going to live with myself?!

        George: Can't live!

        Jerry: I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!

        George: This country needs more people like you!

        Jerry: Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, 
        Dick 
        and Harry in great personal risk.

        George: I believe strongly in that as you know.

        Jerry: There should be more people like us.

        George: That's why the world's in the shape it's in.

        Jerry: You're telling me.

        (Jerry and George both flip pages simultaneously and start reading their 
        
        magazines)

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves to apartment across street, where Jerry is talking to the 
        girl 
        with the blue sweatpants, Becky Gelke, outside her door)
        Jerry: Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything 
        I 
        can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or 
        something very close to that.

        (Becky touches Jerry's arm, smiling)
        Becky: Well God bless you.

        (Jerry pauses)
        Jerry: Thank you very much.

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves to George's apartment, where George and Robin are together 
        in 
        bed)
        George: Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?

        Robin: Oh no, what's wrong?

        George: What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!

        Robin: You didn't commit adultery, I did.

        George: Oh yeah.

        Robin: If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.

        George: Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of 
        
        losers out there.

        Robin: Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.

        George: Well, that's a given.

        Robin: In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.

        George: Must be hell living in that house.

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves to Elaine's apartment, where she is talking on the phone 
        to 
        Michael)
        Michael: Hi, it's Michael.

        Elaine: Hi, Michael!

        Michael: Is Robin there?

        Elaine: Robin? No, why?

        Michael: Uh, she said she was going to be with you.

        Elaine: No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter 
        
        of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, 
        but I 
        have the note, uh, right here.

        (Elaine sits on the couch and crumples newspaper into the phone)
        Michael: If she's not with you, then where is she?

        Elaine: Well I, I don't know.

        Michael: Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!

        Elaine: No, no, come on Michael!

        Michael: He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going 
        to 
        twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break 
        his 
        joints, and reattach them!

        (Michael sneezes)
        Elaine: You're soo good lookin'.

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment, where Jerry and Angela are talking 
        
        by the sofa)
        Angela: Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and 
        I 
        will carve my initials in your brain tissue!

        Jerry: Let me rephra-

        Angela: I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and 
        I'll 
        have a party on your head!

        (Elaine walks in)
        Jerry: Hi Elaine, this is Angela.


        Angela: I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!

        (Jerry walks past her away from the kitchen)
        Jerry: Well I think I get the gist of it.

        Angela: So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!

        (Jerry shrugs)
        Jerry: What car?

        (Jerry hands Angela her purse)
        Angela: Good. I'm glad we understand each other.

        Jerry: It's not complicated.

        (Angela walks out and down hall, Elaine waves)
        Elaine: Very nice meeting you!

        (Intercom buzzes, Elaine hits button while walking toward Jerry)
        Elaine: Come on up.

        (Elaine laughs)
        Elaine: Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! 
        
        When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got 
        
        this scenario right.

        Jerry: Alright Elaine.

        Elaine: No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', 
        kind 
        of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!

        Jerry: It was just a couple of blocks.

        (Elaine takes cup from Jerry and sets it on counter)
        Elaine: Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!

        (George walks in open door, and into kitchen. Elaine walks toward him, 
        Jerry 
        goes to washroom)
        George: Hey.

        Elaine: Oh, did you check you machine?

        (George takes glass from cupboard)
        George: No, why, what's happening?

        Elaine: Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.

        George: Yeah, okay.

        Elaine: And I said I hadn't seen her.

        George: What?!

        Elaine: No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was 
        
        using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and 
        I 
        said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, 
        and 
        then he did mention your name.

        George: He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!

        Elaine: He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.

        George: What? Why couldn't you think of something?!

        Elaine: Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!

        George: You lie! How hard is it to lie?!

        (Jerry walks back from washroom)
        Jerry: It's not that hard.

        (Elaine points finger at George)
        Elaine: Well who told you to sleep with her George?!

        George: It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got 
        her 
        all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!

        Elaine: Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't 
        have 
        said 'God bless you'!

        George: Oh don't-

        (Jerry raises his arms)
        Jerry: Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?

        George: She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.

        Jerry: A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, 
        what 
        was the young man's name?

        Elaine: Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.

        (Jerry uses hand towel to mimic matador)
        Jerry: Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just 
        rolls 
        of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might 
        
        meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Ray's Pizza!

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves to Becky's apartment, where Jerry is talking to her outside 
        her 
        door)
        Jerry: Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the 
        
        damage.

        Becky: Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875.

        Jerry: $875?

        Becky: That's right.

        Jerry: Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then 
        
        this person can pay me back.

        (Jerry takes out checkbook, and start writing)
        Jerry: Um, who do I make it out to?

        Becky: Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.

        Jerry: So, what are you doing this weekend?

        (Jerry hands check to Becky)
        Becky: You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, 
        and 
        now you want to ask me out on a date?

        Jerry: I didn't do it!

        Becky: Yeah righ-

        (Becky sneezes)
        Jerry: You are soo good lookin'.

        (Becky closes door)
        Becky: Thank you.

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry is changing in bedroom and 
        
        George is looking out window)
        George: Jerry, let's go! You ready?

        (Jerry walks out of bedroom)
        Jerry: You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three 
        
        weeks!

        George: Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the 
        
        city.

        Jerry: Alright!

        (George put his bag over his shoulder)
        George: Come on let's get out of here.

        (Kramer enters)
        Kramer: How could you?

        Jerry: What?!

        Kramer: Man! I never thought you were capable of this!

        Jerry: What did I do?

        Kramer: I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit 
        and 
        ran.

        Jerry: I-

        Kramer: I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of 
        friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to 
        the 
        building.

        Jerry: I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!

        Kramer: Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?

        (Jerry is putting on sweater)
        Jerry: No, never.

        Kramer: Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've 
        got a 

        date with her.

        Jerry: You got a date with Becky Gelke?!

        Kramer: Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.

        George: Jerry, can we get out of here?!

        Kramer: As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even 
        had 
        an excuse to talk to her.

        Jerry: Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.

        (Jerry yanks coat out of George's hands)

        --------------------------------------------------

        (Scene moves to outside Becky's apartment. Kramer is walking toward her 
        
        door, hair slicked back, with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. He knocks 
        on 
        her door, she opens. Mary Hart's voice is playing on the TV in the distance. 
        
        Kramer starts having a violent seizure.)



        Opening monologue
        At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, isn't that
        discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass hanging 
        out of
        the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out 
        there
        with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping them. Nobody
        goes, "Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't pull 
        that in
        there."

        First scene.
        Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters.

        Kramer: Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got 
        stolen
        again.

        Jerry: What are you talking about?

        Kramer: Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?

        Jerry: Yeah.

        Kramer: Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.

        Jerry: Oh yeah, I know.

        Kramer: Well, where is it?

        Jerry: What's the difference?

        Kramer: Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.

        Jerry: You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?

        Kramer: What happened to the car?

        Jerry: If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?

        Kramer: Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.

        Jerry: You have to know, you must know.

        Kramer: I must know.

        Jerry: Well, I'm not telling you.

        Kramer: Oh, come on.

        Jerry: Nope. I don't think so.

        Kramer: Well, please?

        Jerry: Not today, pal.

        Kramer: Okay, I beg you.

        Jerry: Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta 
        put
        some beg into it.

        Kramer: Okay, please! Please tell me!

        Jerry: Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.

        Kramer: Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.

        Jerry: I loaned the car to George.

        Kramer: Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?

        Jerry: George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!

        Kramer: Alright.

        Jerry: Huh?

        Kramer: Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?

        Jerry: Will you stop it already?!

        Kramer: You know, why didn't they ask me to go?

        Jerry: I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!

        Kramer: What, they don't like me?

        Jerry: *I* don't like you!

        Kramer: If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.


        New scene.
        George and Elaine are in Jerry's car. George is wearing a new hat.

        George: I really think it looks good.

        Elaine: Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?

        George: All bald people look good in hats.

        Elaine: You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men 
        wore
        hats all the time then.

        George: What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.

        Elaine: Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?

        George: No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about 
        that
        first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment 
        on her
        face.

        Elaine: Are you sure you like these sunglasses?

        Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses 
        and this
        causes George to swerve and hit something.


        Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.

        Kramer: Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know 
        I'm
        somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.

        Jerry: Why not?

        Kramer: Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got
        problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?

        Jerry: Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.

        Kramer and Jerry start 'sparring'.

        Kramer: Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?


        Jerry: No, I like Mike.

        Kramer: Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great
        conversation.

        Jerry: Oh yeah? What did you talk about?

        Kramer: Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty
        interesting things to say.

        Jerry: Oh yeah? What did he say?

        Kramer: You have to know everything, don't you?

        Jerry: No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?

        Kramer: Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?

        Jerry: Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.

        Kramer: Beg me.

        Jerry: Please, don't make me beg.

        Kramer: No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, 
        I just
        want you to put some beg into it. Go on.

        Jerry: Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.

        Kramer: No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. 
        No,
        it's close, but uh...

        Jerry: Kramer!

        Kramer: Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff 
        in
        confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.

        Jerry: Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.

        Kramer: Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.

        Jerry: I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking 
        the
        vault, it's a vault!

        Kramer: He thinks you're a phony.

        Jerry: He what?

        Kramer: I told you, he thinks you're a phony.

        Jerry: A phony? He called me a phony?

        Kramer: A big phone. A big one.

        Jerry: Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!

        Kramer: You begged me.


        Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now making a 
        clanking
        noise.

        George: Do you hear that?

        Elaine: Of course I hear that.

        George: You had to move the mirror?

        Elaine: I wanted to check out my sunglasses.

        George: I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my
        equilibrium.

        Elaine: Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.

        George: I can't drive?

        Elaine: Yeah.

        George: Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you 
        have
        no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left 
        lane? 
        Watch this.

        Elaine: No, I really don't.

        George: And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.

        Elaine: I'm sure you could.

        George: What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?

        Elaine: I don't know.

        George: Alright, start looking for spaces.

        Elaine: Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put 
        it in a
        garage.

        George: Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right 
        in front
        of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.

        Elaine: Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to 
        spend
        an hour looking for a space.

        George: I can't park in a garage.

        Elaine: Why?

        George: I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking,
        it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother,
        nobody. We can't do it.

        Elaine: I'll pay for it.

        George: You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's
        like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, 
        maybe I
        could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? 
        Go
        around me, I'm looking for spaces.

        Elaine (pointing backwards): Oh George, there's a space right there!

        George (putting the car in reverse): Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream
        space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what 
        did
        I tell you?

        Elaine: You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.

        They share a laugh.

        George: Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting 
        into
        his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living
        parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing 
        all
        the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back 
        in,
        that's the key.

        Elaine: Will you just park it already?

        George: There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. 
        It's
        so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at 
        this
        guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my 
        space!

        Elaine: George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for 
        a parking
        space in this city.

        George: No no no, he's not getting away with this.

        Elaine: George?

        George gets out of the car to confront the other driver.

        George: Hey, what are you doing?

        Mike: I think I'm parking my car.

        George: You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like 
        that.

        Mike: I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were 
        just
        sitting there three spaces up.

        George: Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in 
        head
        first?

        Mike: Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in 
        until I
        pulled in.

        George: I was in the middle of a conversation.

        Mike: Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?

        George: The point is I was here first.

        Mike: I was closer to this space than you were.

        George: But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!

        Mike: I can if I have room!


        George: Are you gonna move the car?

        Mike: No, I'm not gonna move the car.

        George: Jerk!

        Mike: Oh, you're not?

        George: Do you believe this guy?

        Elaine: Come on, we'll put it in a garage.

        George: I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.

        Elaine: What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? 
        Uh. 
        I'm going upstairs.

        George: Are you coming back down?

        Elaine: Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.

        George: Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, 
        what
        are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?

        Elaine: Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- 
        Noo.

        George: Oh, come on, you're good at this.

        Elaine: What am I gonna say?

        George: I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.

        Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his in retaliation.


        Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts in.

        Elaine: Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?

        Jerry: Yeah, under the counter. What happened?

        Elaine: Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through 
        on the
        way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing 
        a
        bag of chips off the counter)

        Jerry (bending down to pick up the chips): Tell me what happened.

        Elaine (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted 
        and
        pretending to have downed it): Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth 
        at
        the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack 
        of
        extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some
        reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed 
        the
        toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! 
        
        So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like 
        a
        souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly 
        and the
        car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such 
        a
        great driver.

        Jerry: He is?

        Elaine: Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the 
        air.

        Jerry: A gun?!

        Elaine: I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into 
        the
        city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went 
        home.

        Jerry: My god, are you okay?

        Elaine: Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole 
        and now
        it's making a clanking noise.

        Jerry: Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important 
        thing.

        Elaine: Exactly.

        Jerry: Where's George now?

        Elaine: Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some 
        guy
        about a parking space.

        Jerry: What are you talking about?

        Elaine: Look out the window, you'll see.

        Jerry (leaning out the window): Hey Georgie!

        George: Hey!

        Jerry: Are you okay?

        George: Yeah, I'm fine.

        Jerry: Crazy kids, huh?

        George: What?

        Elaine (desperate to distract Jerry): Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my 
        cuticle.

        Mike: Is that Jerry? Jerry?!

        Jerry: Oh, hey Mike.

        George What, you know Jerry?

        Mike: Yeah, I know Jerry.

        George: How do you know him?

        Mike: What's the difference?

        George: Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.

        Mike: Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real
        piece of work!

        Jerry: I'm coming down.

        Mike: Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?

        George, What, you know Kramer?!

        Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment.

        Elaine: Hi.

        Kramer (acting standoffish): Hello.

        Jerry: Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.

        Kramer (out the window): Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!

        George: And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?

        Mike: Yeah.

        George: Oh great.

        Elaine: You know that guy downstairs?

        Jerry: Yeah, he's a real phony.

        Kramer: What's going on?!

        Mike: Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!

        George: It's my space!

        Kramer: I'll be down in a minute.

        Elaine: Are you going down?

        Kramer: Yeah.

        Elaine: Is anything wrong?

        Kramer (leaving): Why should anything be wrong?

        Elaine (heading for the bathroom): Be down in a minute.

        Jerry grabs his jacket and walks out the door.

        Mike: Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my 
        car if
        I have to.

        George: I'll die out here.

        Two bystanders are discussing the incident.

        Bystander #1: He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's 
        no
        longer his space.

        Bystander #2: No, it doesn't matter. He was-

        Mike: Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!

        Jerry: Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.


        Mike: Hey Krame! You know this guy?

        Kramer: Yeah, yeah, I know him.

        Mike (to Jerry): You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind 
        of
        regimen?

        Jerry: Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too 
        much
        so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another
        fifteen percent.

        Mike (laughing way too loud and hard): Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! 
        
        I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha 
        ha!!!

        George: Oh, come on.

        Mike: Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.

        George: Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into 
        my
        space?

        Mike: Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking 
        in.

        George: You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and 
        you
        didn't have room to parallel park!

        Mike: I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first 
        and if
        you pull out I'll show you!

        George: You've got a prayer.

        Kramer: I go in front first all the time.

        Jerry: Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.

        Elaine shows up and pulls George aside.

        George: Did you talk to him?

        Elaine: Yeah, it's all taken care of.

        George: You told him? What did you tell him?

        Elaine: I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had 
        to have
        been there to appreciate it.

        George: I don't believe it, what did you say?

        Elaine: I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing 
        us and
        they followed us into the city.

        George: A pack of teenagers?

        Elaine: Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved
        that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.

        George: You are a genius, it's as simple as that.

        Elaine: What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach 
        it
        but, you know it's inborn.

        Elaine and George rejoin the others.

        Kramer: By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.

        Elaine: What?

        Kramer: Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.

        George: Oh great.

        Jerry: I didn't know.

        Elaine: Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.

        George: Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.

        Mike: A flea market? You went to a flea market??

        George: Hey, who's talking to you?

        Elaine: We just didn't think of you.

        Kramer: You said it, sister.

        George: What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody 
        I know
        and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?

        People forget. Look at "Home Alone". They forgot.

        George: Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.

        Jerry: I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!

        George: Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.

        Jerry: You're right. My fault.

        Elaine: Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.

        George: Yeah, I'm sorry.

        Kramer: I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.

        George: What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was 
        that
        a good sorry?

        Jerry: It was a so-so sorry.

        A delivery truck pulls up and honks. The driver leans out of the cab.

        Truck Driver: Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!

        George: You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.

        Mike: And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?

        Truck Driver: Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck 
        full of
        ice cream here!

        Fade out/in.

        Elaine: You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through,
        right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan
        drivers to move them.

        Jerry: Wild pack of teenagers, huh?

        George: Yeah.

        Jerry: Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.

        Elaine: Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?

        George: Uh huh.

        Jerry: Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,

        George: Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, 
        what
        you're capable of.

        Elaine: Right.

        George: I learned a lot about myself.

        Jerry: What did you do to my car?!

        George: I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.

        Elaine: Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.

        Jerry: I thought you said you were a good driver!

        George: No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.

        Jerry: I think you said driver.

        George: Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.

        Mike: Will you move it up a little bit?

        George: No no no, that's in the right position.

        Mike: No no, I was further in.

        George: No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.

        Mike: Do you mind?

        George: Do you?

        Sid: Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.

        Jerry: Hey Sid.

        Mike: Who are you?

        Sid: Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to
        George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything 
        gets
        disrupted and disjointed?

        George: Sid, it's completely his fault.


        Mike: Oh, right.

        Sid: Why don't you start taking the bus?

        Jerry: Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The
        fight's starting in two minutes.

        George: Don't do it!

        Jerry: What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?

        George: Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.

        Elaine: Why don't you just flip a coin already?

        George: No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying 
        that
        anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well 
        I'm
        making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting 
        up
        with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting 
        up with
        head first parking.

        Elaine: You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating 
        about
        what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.

        George: So you're against me now?

        An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' frozen 
        yogurt
        store, are discussing the incident.

        Angry man: He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose 
        to go
        in head first.

        Matthew: No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.

        Angry Man: No he wasn't.

        Matthew: All that matters is who was there first.

        Angry Man: Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.

        Matthew: You just spit on me!

        Angry Man: Don't you raise your voice to me!

        Matthew: You're not my father.

        Jerry: Hey Matthew.

        Matthew: Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.

        Jerry: How ya doing?

        Matthew: Okay.

        Jerry: Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.

        Matthew: What?!

        Jerry: Oh no, nothing.

        Matthew: What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?

        Jerry: No, no, no, no.

        Matthew: We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?

        Jerry: No, of course not, of course not!

        Matthew: Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out 
        of
        business. We don't have any money?

        Maryedith: Jerry?! What's the matter with you?

        Jerry: I didn't--

        Maryedith (to Kramer): Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He 
        says
        some pretty stupid things sometimes.

        Kramer: Oh, congratulations.

        Maryedith: What for?

        Kramer: Well, you're pregnant.

        Maryedith: What?

        Kramer: You're not pregnant?

        Maryedith: No, I'm not pregnant.

        Kramer: Are you sure you're not pregnant?

        Maryedith: Yes, I'm sure!

        Kramer: That's weird.

        Maryedith: Come on, Matthew.

        Matthew: No.

        Maryedith: Come on, Matthew!

        Kramer: I thought she was pregnant.

        Jerry (to Elaine): Hey, do you think I'm phony?

        Elaine: What?

        Jerry: Mike thinks I'm a phony.

        Elaine: He thinks you're a phony?

        Jerry: Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to 
        tell
        me.

        Elaine: Oh, you have to say something.

        Jerry: I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.

        Elaine: You gotta open the vault.

        Jerry: Open my vault?

        Elaine: Open your vault.

        Jerry: Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.

        Elaine: You have no choice.

        Jerry: Oy ga-vault.

        Newman (to Kramer): You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll 
        tell
        you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It
        reduces us to jungle law.

        George begins applauding.

        Kramer: When can you park head first?

        Newman: Never.

        Mike: What are you asking this guy for?

        Newman: Who's talking to you?

        George: He's right. never.

        Mike: Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the 
        way
        up to the front car?

        Newman: Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.

        George: When do you ever have ten car lengths?

        Kramer: What about Sundays and holidays?

        George: Oh please.

        A passerby (Sheila) stops and asks George,

        Sheila: What's going on here?

        George: Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.

        Sheila: I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get 
        away
        with it.

        George: Well, thank you for your support.

        Sheila: Hey, that's a great hat.

        George: Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.

        Newman: Hey George, nice hat.

        George: Yeah, thanks.

        Newman: Can I try it on?

        George: No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.

        Newman: Well sure it would.

        George: No! Get out of here, Newman.

        Newman: Come on, let me try it on.


        George: No, Newman, stop it.

        Sheila: Let him try it on.

        George: I don't want him to!

        Sheila: What is wrong with you?

        George: You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) 
        There! 
        There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! 
        
        Here! Try on the hat!

        Newman: Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.

        George: Alright, just keep the hat!

        Jerry: Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs,
        who's coming? Elaine?

        Elaine: It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?

        Kramer: I'm not going if he's going.

        Newman: Me either.

        George: I'm not going if he's going.

        Mike: Well I'm going.

        Jerry: Well if he's going then I'm not going.

        Newman: But it's your house.

        Jerry: I still don't have to go.

        Elaine: Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.

        Mike: Why won't you go if I go?

        Jerry: Why? I'll tell you why.

        Kramer: No. Don't, Jerry.

        Jerry: Like you didn't call me a phony?

        Mike: What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think
        you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary 
        way. I
        mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, 
        sort of
        thing? You know, slang.

        Jerry: Use it in a sentence.

        Mike: Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell 
        him?!?

        Kramer: He begged me.

        Mike: He begged you?!

        Jerry: Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?

        Two police officers walk up.

        Cop #1: Okay, who's cars are these? Let's move 'em. Let's go.

        George: Officer, could I just explain something to you?

        Cop #1: Hey. Let's go or I'm gonna write both of you a ticket in about 
        two
        minutes.

        George: Officer, he can't pull in head first.

        Mike: Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, 
        he was
        sitting there.

        Cop #1: Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head
        first.

        Cop #2: Wait a second. Why can't he go in head first? He said the guy 
        was
        just sitting over there.

        Cop #1: What are you talking about? This guy was here first.

        Cop #2: But he didn't take it.

        Cop #1: Hey, it's his space.

        Cop #2: No, it's his space.

        Cut to Jerry entering his apartment, George and Mike can be heard arguing
        through the window.

        George: Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!

        Mike: Well, you're gonna have to go to work!

        George: I don't have a job!

        Mike: Neither do I!

        Jerry closes the window, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote and 
        turns
        on the TV.

        Referee: Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*

        Jerry falls over and hides his face in the couch cushion.


        Closing monologue.

        People will kill each other for a parking space in New York because they 
        think,
        'If I don't get this one, I may never get a space.' You know? 'I'll be
        circling for months until somebody goes out to the Hamptons.' I think 
        because
        everyone in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars than parking
        spaces. You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night. It's 
        like
        Musical Chairs except everybody sat down around 1964. The problem is car
        manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands of new cars every year, 
        they're
        not making any new spaces. That's what they should be working on. Wouldn't
        that be great? You go to the Auto Show, they got that big revolving turntable,
        and there's nothing on it. New from Chrysler, a space.


        End. 
      

        OPENING MONOLOGUE 

        There are many different job in the police. It seems to me, that the chalk outline 
        guy is one of the better jobs that you can get. You know it's not dangerous, 
        the criminals are long gone, that seems like a good one. I don't know who they 
        are, I guess they're people who wanted to be a sketch artists, but they couldn't 
        draw too well..."listen Johnson, forget the sketches. Do you think if we 
        left a dead body right there on the sidewalk, you could manage to trace around 
        it? Could you do that?". I don't even know how it helps to solve the crime? 
        You know, they look at the thing on the ground..."aah his arm was like 
        that when he hit the pavement. That means the killer must've been Jim." 

        OPENING SCENE 

        GEORGE AND JERRY ARE IN A CAR. GEORGE IS GRABBING JERRY'S ARM 

        George: He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose! 

        Jerry: Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both 
        killed! 

        George: What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? 
        Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police? 

        Jerry: Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy. 

        George: Hope he's not the guy. 

        Jerry: Couldn't be the guy...nah. 

        George: God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger. 

        Jerry: How can you think of food at the time like this? 

        George: Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted. 

        Jerry: I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast! 

        George: I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference 
        threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, 
        because they were only serving breakfast. 

        Jerry: You should've had some eggs. 

        George: For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch? 

        Jerry: Have you ever heard of egg salad? 

        George: Why didn't you say something then? 

        Jerry: I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad? 

        George: I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed. 

        Jerry: I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there. 

        George: Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle. 

        CUT TO KRAMER SINGING IN A SHOWER FOLLOWED BY A FALLING SOUND 

        BACK TO GEORGE AND JERRY ON THE STREET 

        Jerry: I don't have any change. You've got any change? 

        George: No, I don't have any change. I never carry change. 

        Jerry: Well, we need change and all I have is twenties. 

        George: I have a ten. 

        Jerry: So, break it. 

        George: I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them 
        to donate a kidney. 

        Jerry: So, buy something. 

        George: What? 

        Jerry: I don't know, some mints or TicTacs. 

        George: Breath problem? 

        Jerry: No, I just want some change. 

        George: Tell me. 

        Jerry: Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious. 

        George: You know, I haven't eaten anything. 

        Jerry: I just wanna call the police! 

        George: Why don't you just call 911? 

        Jerry: But is this an emergency? 

        George: Of course it is. 

        Jerry: How is this an emergency? 

        George: Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies. 

        Jerry: All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't 
        done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are 
        you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is 
        an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know 
        he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the 
        investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza... 

        George: What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?! 

        Jerry: Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of? 

        George: What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! 
        Why don't you just use your own name? 

        Jerry: Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, 
        they'll believe us. 

        George: Really? 

        Jerry: Sure. 

        George: You think so? 

        Jerry: Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog 
        strangler. [George leans close] would you suck a mint or something. Can I come 
        right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where 
        we are. Where are we? 

        George: I don't know. 

        Jerry: We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy. 

        George: Excuse me, where are we? 

        Man: Earth. 

        Jerry: Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me 
        a wise answer. Ask that woman. 


        George: Excuse me Ms. which street are we on? 

        Woman: I don't know. 

        George: You don't know? 

        Woman: I don't know. 

        George: How come you don't know what street are you on? 

        Woman: You don't know. 

        Jerry: George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, 
        ok...do we know where the 101 is? [George shakes his head] No...do we know where 
        170 is? [George shakes his head] No...do we know where 134 is? [George just 
        looks at Jerry] No. Aha, ok. [Jerry hangs up] He's gonna send a black and white 
        to pick us up. 

        [Police car rolls by the sidewalk and stops. The police listens their conversation.] 

        George: Black and white? 

        Jerry: A cop car. 

        George: Why didn't you just say that? 

        Jerry: I thought it sounded kind of cool. 

        George: Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy. 

        Jerry: Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in. 

        George: I'll bet you, how much? 

        Jerry: Her tip. 

        George: You've got a bet. 

        Jerry: Ok. 

        George: How much do you tip a chamber maid? 

        Police: Which one of you is Costanza? 

        [Jerry and George point at each other.] 

        Police: Get in. 

        George: Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint 
        or piece of gum or... 

        KRAMER IS SHAVING. HE SNEEZES AND GETS SHAVING CREAM ON THE MIRROR 

        BACK TO THE POLICE CAR WITH JERRY, GEORGE AND TWO COPS 

        George: Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window. 

        JERRY SEARCHES FOR THE HANDLE, BUT CAN'T FIND ONE 

        Jerry: Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here. 

        Cop: Cut it up back there. 

        George: He started it. 

        Jerry: I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights? 

        Cop: I don't think so. 

        Jerry: But you could? 

        Cop: Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want. 

        Cop 2: We could drive on the wrong side of the road. 

        Cop: Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces. 

        Cop 2: Shoot people... 

        George: You guys ever shot anybody? 

        Cops: No... 

        George: Hey, can I flip on the siren? 

        Jerry: Why are you bothering them for? 

        George: I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no. 

        Cop: Yeah, go ahead. 

        GEORGE TRIES THE SIREN. 

        George: Wohoo, check it out. 

        Jerry: Can I try it? 

        Cop: Yeah, go ahead, hurry up. 

        JERRY TRIES THE SIREN 

        Jerry: Scared the hell out of that guy. 

        George: You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? 
        When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". 
        Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo 
        was more effective than waa? 

        Jerry: Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa... 

        Jerry and George: Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa... 

        Cop: Hey! 

        KRAMER IS COMBING HIS HAIR. TRYING TO GET THE COMB THROUGH. 

        Kramer: I'm dizzy. 

        BACK TO THE POLICE CAR 

        Jerry: Nice shotgun. 

        Cop: Thanks. 

        Jerry: Clean as a whistle. 

        George: You could eat of that shotgun. 

        Jerry: What is that, a 12 gauge? 

        Cop: Yeah. 

        Jerry: 12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge. 

        George: My favorite. 

        Jerry: Mine too, love the 12 gauge. 

        George: Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol. 

        Cop: What do got over there? 

        Cop 2: I don't know. 

        Cop: Looks like a possible 5-19. 

        Jerry: 5-19? What's a 5-19? 

        George: Where? 

        Cop 2: Think so? 

        Cop: Looks like it. 

        Jerry: I can't believe this. A 5-19? 

        George: Where, where? I can't see. 

        Cop: This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over. 

        Cop 2: All right, let's pull over and check it out. 

        Jerry: Pull over? You can't pull over. 

        George: What are you doing? Where do you think you're going? 

        Jerry: Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us. 

        George: Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here. 

        Jerry: We have an appointment! 

        George: What are you doing?! 

        Jerry: Great. 

        COPS GO TO ARREST A GUY FOR TRYING TO STEAL A CAR 

        George: There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there. 

        Jerry: Which flavor? 

        George: Milano. 

        Jerry: Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this? 

        George: Should I take some? 

        Jerry: I think that's a 5-19. 

        George: I'm starving... 

        GEORGE REACHES FOR THE COOKIES AND THE COPS SLAM A GUY ON THE HOOD AND GEORGE 
        BACKS AWAY 

        Jerry: They're busting this guy. 

        George: They're cuffing him. 


        Jerry: I can't believe this. 

        GEORGE GET CLOSER TO JERRY AND THEY THROW THE GUY NEXT TO GEORGE 

        MONOLOGUE: 

        I can't believe that cops still have to read that whole "you have the right 
        to remain silence"-speech to every criminal they arrest. I mean is there 
        anybody who doesn't know that by now? Can't they just go "Freeze, you're 
        under arrest. You've ever seen Baretta? Yeah, good, get in the car." 

        BACK TO POLICE CAR 

        George: Hi. 

        Jerry: Hi, I'm Jerry. 

        George: George, how you doing? 

        GEORGE OFFERS HIS HAND, BUT THE GUY IS IN CUFFS 

        Guy: What did you do? 

        George: Nothing. 

        Jerry: Nothing. 

        Guy: Oh yeah right, me neither. Hey I didn't do nothing! 

        Cop: Shut up. 

        Jerry: Hot out. 

        Guy: Brutal. 

        George: What do you tip a chamber maid. 

        Guy: I don't know, five bucks a night. 

        Jerry: No, a dollar, two tops. 

        Guy: Hey, you guys aren't cuffed. What are you, narks? 

        George: Narks? 

        Jerry: Imagine, us narks? 

        George: No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer. 

        Guy: Really? Well, that's very nice. 

        George: Oh, thank you. 

        Jerry: Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it. 

        George: Yeah well, we don't think. 

        Jerry: We're pretty sure. 

        Guy: A dollar a night? 

        Jerry: Yeah, that's a good tip! 

        Guy: That stinks! 

        Jerry: I read it in Ann Landers. 

        Guy: Oh, Ann Landers sucks! 

        Cop 2: Hey, shut it up back there. 

        Police radio: Attention all units, attention all units, all units code 3. All 
        units in the area, code 3 in progress, 1648 North Bartholis, units required 
        for assistance in apprehension of 702. 

        Cop: That's smog strangler. 

        Jerry: Kramer. 

        Cop 2: Got him. Let's go. 

        POLICE CAR COMES TO THE SCENE. JERRY OPENS THE BACK DOOR THROUGH THE WINDOW 
        AND THEY GO AFTER THE COPS 

        Jerry: I wanna see what's happening. 

        George: I don't know why I'm doing this. 

        LT MARTEL KNOCKS ON A DOOR AND KRAMER OPENS 

        Kramer: Jerry, George! 

        Lt. Martel: You are under arrest in first degree murder and death of Ms Chelsea 
        Lang. 

        THE CAR THIEVE GUY RUNS AWAY FROM THE DOOR THAT JERRY AND GEORGE LEFT OPEN 

        KRAMER IS RUSHED THROUGH A GROUP OF PRESS 

        Reporters: Why did you do it? What possessed you? 

        Kramer: I don't know... 

        COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES CENTRAL JAIL 

        JERRY AND GEORGE ARE VISITING KRAMER 

        Kramer: Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George! 

        Jerry: We're doing fine. How are you? 

        Kramer: What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot 
        of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in 
        development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. 
        You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player. 

        George: A player? 

        Kramer: Yeah, a player... 

        Jerry: Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here? 

        Kramer: What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess 
        who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're 
        talking about doing a project together. 

        Jerry: Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer! 

        Kramer: So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? 
        Jerry? George? 

        Jerry: Well, yeah...sure. 

        Police: Kramer, let's go. The Lieutenant wants to see you. 

        Kramer: Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have 
        lunch together, huh? 

        KRAMER GOES WITH THE POLICE OFFICER, BUT ASKS IF HE COULD SAY JUST ONE MORE 
        THING 

        Kramer: Help me!! Help me! 

        OFFICER DRAGS KRAMER AWAY 

        KRAMER IS BEEN INTERROGATED BY LT. MARTEL 

        Kramer: I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God! 

        Lt. Martel: Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer. My God is the god who protects 
        the innocent and punishes the evil scum like you, have you got that? 

        Kramer: You're making a big mistake. 

        Lt. Martel: No! You have made the mistake, Kramer. Sickies like you always do. 
        The only difference is that this time you're gonna pay. 

        Kramer: What? 

        Lt. Martel: Now you might beat the gas chamber Kramer, but as long as I have 
        got a breath in my body you will never ever see the light of day again. 

        Kramer: Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me! 

        Lt. Martel: Oh yeah, right. Maybe it was one of your other personalities huh, 
        the wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ball player, maybe the door to 
        door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. 
        You just couldn't help yourself, could you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly 
        with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out. 

        Kramer: Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain... 

        Lt. Martel: I'm not interested in your explanations, Kramer! Sure, I bet you've 
        got a million of 'em. Maybe your mother didn't love you enough, maybe the teacher 
        didn't call on you in school when you had your little hand raised, maybe the 
        pervert in the park had a present in his pants, huh? Well, I've got another 
        theory Kramer: you're a weed. 

        Kramer: No... 

        Lt. Martel: Society is filled with them. They're choking the life out of the 
        all pretty flowers. 

        KRAMER SOBS 

        Lt. Martel: You see something even remotely pretty and you have to choke the 
        life out if it, don't you Kramer? 

        KRAMER CRIES 

        Lt. Martel: You killed all the pretty flowers, didn't you Kramer? You killed 
        the pretty little flowers, didn't you? You dirty, filthy, stinky weed! Didn't 
        you? 

        PHONE RINGS 

        Officer: Lieutenant, it's for you. 

        Lt. Martel: Martel...yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah. 


        KRAMER KEEPS CRYING 

        Officer: What it is, Lieutenant? 

        Lt. Martel: Let him go. 

        Officer: What, but Lieutenant? 

        Lt. Martel: You heard me, let him go. They just found another body at the Laurel 
        Canyon. Go on Kramer, get out of my sight. 

        Kramer: Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park? 

        Lt. Martel: I said beat it! 

        JERRY AND GEORGE ARE WAITING OUTSIDE OF THE JAIL 

        KRAMER WALKS OUT 

        Kramer: Hahaa! 

        George: What? 

        Jerry: What happened? 

        Kramer: Somebody got killed while they had me in custody. 

        Jerry: Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed! 

        George: You're kidding? Somebody else got killed? 

        Jerry: While you were in jail. So you're free. 

        Kramer: Yes, I'm free. [singing] 'cause the murderer struck again! 

        THEY ALL DANCE A FEW STEPS AND THEN AS A POLICE GOES BY THEY LEAVE QUIETLY 

        KRAMER, JERRY AND GEORGE AT THE HILLS OF L.A. 

        Jerry: So Kramer, what are you going to do? 

        Kramer: Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I 
        do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it. 

        George: Kramer, what the hell are you talking about? 

        Kramer: What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way 
        that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? 
        That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely 
        place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no 
        better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer 
        in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say? 

        George: I'd like to hear that. 

        Jerry: Yeah... 

        Kramer: Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for 
        me here. I met a girl... 

        Jerry: Kramer, she was murdered! 

        Kramer: Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV. 

        George: As a suspect in a serial killing. 

        Kramer: Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything. 

        George: What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill. 

        Jerry: So you're not gonna come back to New York with us? 

        Kramer: No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen. 

        George: Taste this, is this a dill? 

        Jerry: No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had 
        about you having my apartment keys and everything. 

        Kramer: Ok, it's forgotten. 

        George: Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy. 

        Jerry: Well, take it easy. 

        Kramer: Yeah, ok. 

        George: Yeah, take care. Stay in touch. 

        Kramer: Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug... 

        Jerry: Oh, no... 

        George: No, you're crushing my sandwich. 

        JERRY AND GEORGE AT THE HOTEL. GEORGE IS KICKING THE TUCKED COVERS. 

        Jerry: Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you. 

        BACK TO JERRY'S APARTMENT. GEORGE AND JERRY ARE WATCHING TV. 

        George: Mint? 

        Jerry: No thanks. 

        George: I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe. 

        Jerry: It's been three days already, forget about Lupe. 

        George: Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home? 

        Jerry: No, I don't. 

        George: You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, 
        throw in a few soaps. 

        Jerry: Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too. 

        George: I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love 
        me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like 
        Lenin. 

        Jerry: How much did you wound up tipping her? 

        George: Oh my God, I forgot! 

        Jerry: Well, communism didn't work. 

        KRAMER WALKS IN 

        Kramer: Hey! 

        KRAMER GOES TO THE FRIDGE 

        Kramer: Any mustard? This is empty. 

        Jerry: Yeah, there's a new one in there. 

        Kramer: No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles? 

        Jerry: Help yourself. 

        Kramer: Yeah, all right. 

        George: Kramer, what are you doing here? 

        Kramer: Getting something to eat. 

        Jerry: Kramer, here! 

        JERRY THROWS THE APARTMENT KEYS TO KRAMER. KRAMER WALKS OUT AND COMES BACK WITH 
        HIS KEYS. 
        HE THROWS THEM TO THE TABLE KNOCKING JERRY'S SODA. 

        ACTION NEWS. KEITH MORRISON. 

        Newscaster: Authorities exposed today, that the latest suspect in the smog strangling 
        was apprehended this week on an unrelated charge, but somehow managed to escape 
        from the police car, in which he was being held. Tobias Lehigh Nagy, who is 
        also wanted in connection with a series of unrelated slains in the North West 
        is still at large, his whereabouts unknown. He's described as 5'5" bald 
        and reputedly a very generous tipper. 

        CLOSING MONOLOGUE 

        The thing about L.A. to me, that kind of threw me, was when they have these 
        smog alerts out there and they actually recommend that people stay indoors during 
        the smog alert. Now, maybe I'm way off, but don't you think, wouldn't you assume, 
        that the air in the house pretty much comes from the air in the city where the 
        house is? I mean what do they think, that we live in a jar with couple of holes 
        punched in the top? What the hell is going on out there? It's very strange, 
        do you realize that it's now possible for parents to say to their children "All 
        right kids, I want you in the house and get some fresh air! Summer vacation, 
        everybody indoors." 

        THE END

              [At club bar]

              Jerry and George are talking. Stu and Jay enter. 

              STU: Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC. 

              JERRY: Hi. 

              STU: Could we speak for a few moments?

              JERRY: Sure. 

              JAY: Hi, Jay Crespi.

              JERRY: Hello. 

              GEORGE: Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?

              JAY: That's right. 

              GEORGE: I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last 
              name.

              JAY: Mm, I'm not-

              JERRY: George-

              GEORGE: (backing off) Huh? All right, fine. 

              STU: First of all, that was a terrific show.

              JERRY: Oh thank you very much. 

              STU: And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been 
              
              discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested 
              in
              doing something. 

              JERRY: Really? Wow. 

              STU: So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, 
              
              we'd just love to talk about it. 

              JERRY: I'd be very interested in something like that. 

              STU: Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can 
              develop
              a series. 

              They start to exit. 

              JERRY: Okay. Great. Thanks.

              STU: It was very nice meeting you. 

              Jery: Thank you.

              JAY: Nice meeting you.

              JERRY: Nice meeting you.

              [George returns]

              GEORGE: What was that all about?

              JERRY: They said they were interested in me. 

              GEORGE: For what?

              JERRY: You know, a TV show. 

              GEORGE: Your own show?

              JERRY: Yeah, I guess so. 

              GEORGE: They want you to do a TV show?

              JERRY: Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't 
              have
              any ideas. 

              GEORGE: Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on 
              TV.
              You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high 
              
              school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics 
              
              and you're pushing him into gymnastics. 

              JERRY: Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?

              GEORGE: Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural. 
              

              JERRY: But gymnastics is not for everybody. 

              GEORGE: I know, but he's your son. 

              JERRY: So what?

              GEORGE: All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, 
              I 
              got it. You run an antique store. 

              JERRY: Yeah and...?

              GEORGE: And people come in the store and you get involved in their
              lives. 

              JERRY: What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's
              lives?

              GEORGE: Why not?

              JERRY: So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden 
              I'm
              getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because 
              a
              pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in. 

              GEORGE: I know, but antiques are very popular right now. 

              JERRY: No they're not, they used to be. 

              GEORGE: Oh yeah, like you know.

              JERRY: Oh like you do. 

              [Jerry's Apartment]

              KRAMER: ...And you're the manager of the circus. 

              JERRY: A circus?

              KRAMER: Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've
              got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, 
              who 
              wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the 
              
              tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head. 

              JERRY: I don't think so. 

              KRAMER: Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about 
              watching 
              freaks.

              JERRY: I don't think the network will go for it. 

              KRAMER: Why not?

              JERRY: Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.

              KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch 
              freaks. 
              This is a "can't miss." 

              NEWMAN:Kramer.


              JERRY: Hello Newman.

              NEWMAN: Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.

              KRAMER: All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my 
              party? [exits]

              Together: Yeah, sure.

              JERRY: What's this all about?

              NEWMAN: We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet 
              - he's giving me his radar detector.

              JERRY: I didn't know you had a motorctcle.

              NEWMAN: Well my girlfriend had one.

              JERRY: You have a girlfriend?

              NEWMAN: I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.

              JERRY: I never remember you with a girl.

              NEWMAN: Nevertheless, ...

              JERRY: This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector 
              is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.

              NEWMAN: Don't say anything.

              JERRY: All right.

              [Kramer enters]

              JERRY: You know you're getting gypped over here.

              KRAMER: Really, Ah, 

              NEWMAN: We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you 
              reneging? That's a renege.

              KRAMER: Oh, stop saying 'reneging".

              NEWMAN: Well you're reneging.

              KRAMER: I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.

              [they try to exchange items but won't let go]

              NEWMAN: All right give it to me. let go ...

              KRAMER: You let go - come on ...[they fight over the items]

              JERRY: Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!

              NEWMAN: Thanks buddy. So long he he ...[exits]

              JERRY: Does that thing work?

              KRAMER: Nah.

              At Monks.

              [Jerry and George enter.]

              JERRY: ... I just got a postcard from Elaine?

              GEORGE: Really?

              JERRY: Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.

              GEORGE: I can't believe she got involved with a shrink. 

              GEORGE: So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with 
              anything?

              JERRY: No, nothing.

              GEORGE: Why don't they have salsa on the table?

              JERRY: What do you need salsa for?

              GEORGE: Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.

              JERRY: You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." 
              "Excuse me, do
              you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where 
              is the salsa? No salsa?"

              GEORGE: You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order
              seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."

              JERRY: "Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? 
              You 
              have the seltezer after the salsa!"

              GEORGE: See, this should be a show. This is the show. 

              JERRY: What?

              GEORGE: This. Just talking. 

              JERRY: (dismissing) Yeah, right. 

              GEORGE: I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea. 

              JERRY: Just talking? Well what's the show about?

              GEORGE: It's about nothing. 

              JERRY: No story?

              GEORGE: No forget the story. 

              JERRY: You've got to have a story. 

              GEORGE: Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting 
              for, 
              for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could 
              be a TV
              show.

              JERRY: And who is on the show? Who are the characters?

              GEORGE: I could be a character.

              JERRY: You?

              GEORGE: Yeah. You could base a character on me.

              JERRY: So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?

              GEORGE: Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. 
              People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a 
              character."

              JERRY: And who else is on the show?

              GEORGE: Elaine could be a character. Kramer..

              JERRY: Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character 
              on the show.

              GEORGE: Right.

              JERRY: And it's about nothing?

              GEORGE: Absolutely nothing.

              JERRY: So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this 
              idea for a show about nothing.

              GEORGE: We go into NBC.

              JERRY: "We"? Since when are you a writer?

              GEORGE: (Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.

              JERRY: You want to go with me to NBC?

              GEORGE: Yeah. I think we really go something here.

              JERRY: What do we got?

              GEORGE: An idea.

              JERRY: What idea?

              GEORGE: An idea for the show.

              JERRY: I still don't know what the idea is.

              GEORGE: It's about nothing. 

              JERRY: Right.

              GEORGE: Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.

              JERRY: So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a 
              show about nothing.

              GEORGE: Exactly.

              JERRY: They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."

              GEORGE: There you go.

              (A moment passes)

              JERRY: (Nodding) I think you may have something there.


              [Jerry's apartment]

              (Jerry's explaining George's idea to Kramer)

              JERRY: So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the 
              characters would be based on you.


              KRAMER: (Thinks) No, I don't think so.

              JERRY: What do you mean you don't think so?

              KRAMER: I don't like it.

              JERRY: I don't understand. What don't you like about it?

              KRAMER: I don't like the idea of a character based on me.

              JERRY: Why not?

              KRAMER: well it just doesn't sit well.

              JERRY: You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on 
              you.

              KRAMER: That's your problem, buddy.

              JERRY: I don't understand what the big deal is.

              KRAMER: Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.

              JERRY: Whatever you want.

              KRAMER: I get to play Kramer.

              JERRY: You can't play Kramer.

              KRAMER: I am Kramer.

              JERRY: But you can't act.

              KRAMER: Phew!

              [Newman enters]

              JERRY: Okay, fine. We'll use Newman. 

              KRAMER: Newman?

              NEWMAN:Use me for what?

              JERRY: Nothin' What do you want?

              NEWMAN:Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was 
              uh, driving [ Jerry and Kramer turn away] home on the palisades 
              parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? 
              The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I 
              didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?

              KRAMER: Yeah. That's strange. 

              NEWMAN:A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH 
              A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason 
              I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.

              KRAMER: That's queer uh?

              NEWMAN:I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE 
              GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.

              KRAMER: Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo. 

              NEWMAN:You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?

              JERRY: Buyer beware. 

              NEWMAN:Are you going to give me back that helmet or not? 

              KRAMER: No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.

              NEWMAN:No, but there's karma, Kramer.

              JERRY: Karma Kramer?

              NEWMAN:And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. [exits]

              (Jerry and George are waiting)

              JERRY: (To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any 
              salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the 
              matter?

              GEORGE: (Nervous) Nothing.

              JERRY: You sure? You look a little pale.

              GEORGE: No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.

              JERRY: What, are you nervous?

              GEORGE: No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) 
              I can't do this! Can't do this!

              JERRY: What?

              GEORGE: I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. 
              It's impossible.

              JERRY: This was your idea!

              GEORGE: What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were 
              going to listen to me.

              JERRY: Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.

              GEORGE: They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. 
              They're married, they have secretaries.

              JERRY: I told you not to come.

              GEORGE: I need some water. I gotta get some water.

              JERRY: They'll give us water in there.

              GEORGE: Really? That's pretty good.

              [Jerry looks into hallway]

              JERRY: Oh God, it's Joe Devola.


              GEORGE: Who?

              JERRY: This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to 
              the same shrink as Elaine.

              JERRY: Oh God he saw me.

              DEVOLA: Hello Jerry.

              JERRY: Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?

              DEVOLA: You're under no obligation to shake my hand.

              JERRY: Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK 
              GOOD.

              DEVOLA: Why shouldn't I look good?

              JERRY: Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?

              DEVOLA: You want to hit me?

              JERRY: What are you doing here?

              DEVOLA: I dreopped a script off.

              JERRY: AH, GOOD FOR YOU.

              [they stare at each other]

              DEVOLA: You don't have to say anything.

              JERRY: No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.

              DEVOLA: Why?

              JERRY: Kramer's party.

              DEVOLA: Kramer's ... having ... a ... party? 

              JERRY: No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I 
              don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.

              DEVOLA: Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.

              JERRY: No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. 
              Very close.

              invite him. I better call Kramer, ...

              [before he can dial]


              RECEPTIONIST: They're ready for you.

              GEORGE: Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?

              JERRY: Relax. Who are they?

              GEORGE: Yeah, they're not better than me.

              JERRY: Course not.


              GEORGE: Who are they?

              JERRY: They're nobody.

              GEORGE: What about me?

              JERRY: What about you?

              GEORGE: Why them? Why not me?

              JERRY: Why not you?

              GEORGE: I'm as good as them.

              JERRY: Better.

              GEORGE: You really think so?

              JERRY: No.

              (The door opens, and, from Jerry and George's point of view, four 
              executives stand up)

              (Scene ends)
              [ NBC president's office]

              (Stu Chermak, Susan Ross, Jay Crespi, and Russell Dalrymple, the 
              head of the network, are all talking with Jerry and George)

              STU: (To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit 
              I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now 
              that's funny.

              GEORGE: The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.

              JERRY: Yeah, it's one of my favorites.

              RUSSELL: What about you, George? Have you written anything we might 
              know?

              GEORGE: (Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway 
              show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. 
              It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.

              JERRY: Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the 
              chef - what was his name?

              GEORGE: Pepe.

              JERRY: Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.

              SusaNEWMAN:Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?

              GEORGE: No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.

              RUSSELL: So, what have you two come up with?

              JERRY: Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But 
              the basic idea is I will play myself-

              GEORGE: (Interrupting) May I?

              JERRY: Go ahead.

              GEORGE: I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: NOTHING.

              RUSSELL: Nothing?

              GEORGE: (Smiling) Nothing.

              RUSSELL: (Unimpressed) What does that mean?

              GEORGE: The show is about nothing.

              JERRY: (To George) Well, it's not about nothing.

              GEORGE: (To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.

              JERRY: Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.

              (Jerry and George glare at each other. The receptionist enters)

              Receptionist: Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.

              GEORGE:(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?

              RUSSELL: (Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.

              GEORGE: Is it with a "y"?

              RUSSELL: No.

              SusaNEWMAN:What's the premise?

              JERRY: ..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, 
              living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, 
              which is all true.

              GEORGE: Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just 
              like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, 
              you read, You go shopping.

              RUSSELL: You read? You read on the show?

              JERRY: Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss 
              the reading.

              RUSSELL: All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind 
              of stories?

              GEORGE: Oh, no. No stories.

              RUSSELL: No stories? So, what is it?

              GEORGE: (Showing an example) What'd you do today?

              RUSSELL: I got up and came to work.

              GEORGE: There's a show. That's a show.

              RUSSELL: (Confused) How is that a show?

              JERRY: Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.

              GEORGE: No, no, no. Nothing happens.

              JERRY: Well, something happens.

              RUSSELL: Well, why am I watching it?

              GEORGE: Because it's on TV.

              RUSSELL: (Threatening) Not yet.

              GEORGE: Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same 
              old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not 
              going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you
              something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. 
              (To Jerry) Right?

              (A moment passes)

              JERRY: (To Russell) How about this: I manage a circus..


              [Monks]

              JERRY: I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you 
              thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, 
              where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have 
              no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist 
              couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. 
              You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University 
              level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking 
              at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. 
              Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team 
              of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having 
              conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant 
              Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're 
              going to get better. 

              GEORGE: . . . I thought the woman was kind of cute. 

              JERRY: Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking 
              about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking 
              about? 

              GEORGE: Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet 
              that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been 
              introduced. She knows my name. 

              JERRY: IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!

              GEORGE: Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right 
              at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good 
              eye contact the whole meeting. 

              JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.

              GEORGE: Wait a minute let me call Susan.

              JERRY: No, no this is more important.

              GEORGE: She might be leaving to work any minute.

              JERRY: No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.

              GEORGE: No.

              [they race to the pay phone]

              [Paris hotel room - Dr. Reston and Elaine are kissing]

              ELAINE: What is it?


              DR. RESTON: I was just thinking about this patient of mine.

              ELAINE: What?

              DR. RESTON: Just wondering if he's taking his medication.

              ELAINE: Well, come on we're on vacation. 

              [Jerry's apartment]

              JERRY: Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and 
              you know how Devola is. He's all, ... [buzzer]

              KRAMER: Yeah [to buzzer]

              GEORGE: [OC] It's George.

              JERRY: And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know 
              I just blurted out something about your party.

              KRAMER: Whoa, back up a second. 

              JERRY: Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.

              KRAMER: Why would you think I would invite him?

              JERRY: I just a ssumed, ...

              KRAMER: Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in 
              my house. You know he's on medication. 

              [George and Susan enter]

              GEORGE: Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.

              JERRY: Of course. How are you?

              SUSAN: Fine, it's good to see you.

              GEORGE: And this is Kramer.

              SUSAN: Hello.

              GEORGE: All right go ahead Susan, tell him.

              JERRY: Tell me what?

              SUSAN: Well, I, [phone rings]

              JERRY: Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.

              TEL: Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance 
              service.

              JERRY: Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your 
              home number and I'll call you later. 

              TEL: Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that. 

              JERRY: Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.

              TEL: No.

              JERRY: Well now you know how I feel. [Hangs up]

              GEORGE: Well, go ahead, tell him.

              JERRY: Kramer, are you drinking that milk? 

              KRAMER: Yeah.

              JERRY: What's the expiration date on that?

              KRAMER: September third.

              JERRY: The third?

              GEORGE: and SUSAN: The third?

              KRAMER: Um, Uh, ugh, ...

              SUSAN: Noooo... [Kramer throws up on Susan]

              [Monk's]

              GEORGE: I never should have brought her up there. Should have known 
              better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.

              JERRY: I think SHE saw it coming.

              GEORGE: You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion 
              the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And 
              she liked me. 

              JERRY: Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the 
              deal is dead.

              GEORGE: What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown 
              up on.

              JERRY: Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on 
              Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia. 
              

              GEORGE: Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd 
              still give you half of Europe.

              [Kramer enters with helmet]

              JERRY: What happened to you?

              KRAMER: Devola came after me. 

              JERRY: What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe 
              this. What happened?

              KRAMER: Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home 
              and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new 
              strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out 
              to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the 
              side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe 
              Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party." 
              

              JERRY: Boy,that is some kick.

              KRAMER: Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.

              JERRY: Wow, Newman's helmet.

              GEORGE: Holly.

              KRAMER: I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next. 

              JERRY: Me, why? 

              KRAMER: He doesn't like you. 

              JERRY: What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this 
              is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. 
              He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.

              KRAMER: Pass the cream.

              GEORGE: Wait a second. [smells it]. all right.

        COMEDY CLUB 

        The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that men are all 
        the
        same, so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding is 
        like
        the joining together of a beautiful glowing bride, and some guy. The tuxedo
        is a wedding safety device created by women because they know that men 
        are
        undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just takes 
        one
        step over and she marries the next guy. Thats why the wedding vow isn't 
        'do
        you take Bill Simpson', its 'do you take this man'.

        JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT

        The door is open. Elaine knocks and then enters.

        ELAINE: Joey? Joey?

        She sees a wall covered in photos of her.
        Joe Divola enters and shuts the front door.

        ELAINE: Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
        JOE DIVOLA: Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.
        ELAINE: You left your door open.
        JOE DIVOLA: I know, I like to encourage intruders.
        ELAINE: (laughs) Whats all this?
        JOE DIVOLA: Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.
        ELAINE: Where did you get all these pictures?
        JOE DIVOLA: I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your
        office, your apartment, shopping, showering.
        ELAINE: Showering?
        JOE DIVOLA: I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to 
        see?
        ELAINE: In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day
        person!... Are you all right?
        JOE DIVOLA: Why
        ELAINE: Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
        JOE DIVOLA: Who am I? Who am I supposed to be?
        ELAINE: Thats a good question, good question, its very... exerstential!
        Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
        JOE DIVOLA: What are you doing here?
        ELAINE: Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
        JOE DIVOLA: Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from 
        that
        friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it.
        ELAINE: Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
        JOE DIVOLA: Really?
        ELAINE: Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something
        on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere 
        so
        Im just gonna get the uh..

        Divola is blocking the door with his head.

        JOE DIVOLA: You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?
        ELAINE: Uh.. Im Elaine!
        JOE DIVOLA: He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.
        ELAINE: Oh.
        JOE DIVOLA: Do you think Im a clown, Nedda?
        ELAINE: Do I think you're a clown? No, not if its bad to be a clown, 
        if
        its bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its 
        good
        to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
        JOE DIVOLA: You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is 
        he.
        I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.
        ELAINE: Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, Im gonna... 
        get
        out of here.

        Divola blocks the door when Elaine tries to leave.

        JOE DIVOLA: Pagliacci kills his wife.
        ELAINE: Se, now thats terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, 
        I
        dont know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume
        that there is big big trouble for that clown
        JOE DIVOLA: You're not leaving

        Elaine sprays Divola in the eyes and he falls on his back. Elaine leaves.

        JERRY'S APARTMENT.

        Jerry:(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, thats
        not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd
        investigate. So whats the difference, Im a comedian of the United States,
        and Ill tell you Im under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway,
        ok bye.

        Knock at door.

        JERRY: (cautiously) Who is it?
        GEORGE: It's George.

        George enters wearing a very small tuxedo.

        GEORGE: What, are you locking the door now?
        JERRY: Well, well, look at you. Its a little skimpy there isn't it?
        GEORGE: Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when 
        I
        made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
        JERRY: Ooo, that was a bad toast.
        GEORGE: It wasn't that bad.
        JERRY: I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
        GEORGE: I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
        JERRY: There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a 
        Red
        Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were
        just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of 
        the
        worst all time toasts.
        GEORGE: Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, 
        he
        could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's 
        not
        going tonight you know.
        JERRY: What do you mean not going? why not?
        GEORGE: I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at 
        the
        airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
        JERRY: Why doesn't she pay for hers?
        GEORGE: That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner,
        she doesn't even reach for the check. Thats all Im asking for is a reach.
        Is that so much to ask for?
        JERRY: It's nice to get a reach.

        Loud thump is heard from the front door.

        JERRY: Who is it?
        KRAMER: It's me!

        Kramer is on the floor

        KRAMER: What, are you locking the door now?
        JERRY: Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
        KRAMER: I am dressed.
        JERRY: You're going like this?
        KRAMER: Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
        JERRY: I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
        KRAMER: People do, I don't.
        JERRY: Well what about me! If you're going like that, Im not going like
        this.
        GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think Im comfortable here. 
        I
        can't change, Ive got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I 
        cant
        go like this alone!
        JERRY: Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer 
        to
        town hall than yours?
        GEORGE: Thats not the issue, we're friends, if Ive got to be
        uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
        JERRY: All right, all right, Ill wear this. It's bad enough Ive got 
        to go
        to the opera Ive got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.

        Kramer is playing opera music

        JERRY: Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
        KRAMER: It's Pagliacci!
        JERRY: Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got 
        two
        extra tickets.
        KRAMER: Why? What happened?
        JERRY: Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend
        isn't going either.
        KRAMER: Thats fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five
        hundred a ticket.
        GEORGE: What? Really?
        KRAMER: Yeah.
        GEORGE: People are looking for tickets here?
        KRAMER: What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. 
        Ha,
        we're gonna clean up!
        GEORGE: Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
        JERRY: Oh yeah right.
        KRAMER: OK come on, lets go get the tickets.
        GEORGE: All right, all right.
        JERRY: All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll
        meet you in front of the theatre.
        GEORGE: Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?
        KRAMER: Oh yeah!

        Kramer and George leave.

        year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry,

        ELAINE: It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different

        Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, 

        I feel
        very vulnerable.

        don't care about money.

        problem?

        JERRY: Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteens father-in-law, Mr Reichman.
        George and I were just talking about that today, I cant believe it! Thats
        the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
        ELAINE: Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
        JERRY: Do you remember the curse toast?
        ELAINE: Oh yeah, the curse toast.
        JERRY: So, can you believe that message? Now Ive got to spend the rest

        ELAINE: Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused
        me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his
        name!!
        JERRY: Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with
        you! He'll think Im the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away 
        his
        girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
        ELAINE: Oooohh, what about me!

        Divola walks up to them, dressed in the clown suit.

        JOE DIVOLA: Excuse me
        ELAINE&JERRY: Aaahhhhh!!

        ALLEYWAY

        George still hasn't sold the ticket.

        GEORGE: But this is Pavarotti!
        MAN#3: Three hundred dollars, thats a lot of money.

        Mr & Mrs Reichman are walking through the alley

        MR REICHMAN: You know Steven Holstman (?) did a production at Tunis last
        yeas and from what I understand, the Moslems really took to it.
        GEORGE: All right, Ill tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, lets

        jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, Ive got people
        waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
        MR REICHMAN: Scalping! I told them to put out extra security.. Excuse

        OUTSIDE THE THEATRE

        JOE DIVOLA: Anything is welcome, I accept change.
        JERRY: I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
        JOE DIVOLA: You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate
        me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person.
        JERRY: I'm telling you, the guy took.....
        JOE DIVOLA: And I don't need people like you looking down their noses 
        at
        me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get 
        by.

        Mrs Reichman runs past

        MRS REICHMAN: Doctor! Doctor! Is there a doctor anywhere!
        JOE DIVOLA: What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that 
        it?
        ELAINE: I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't
        really work out.
        JOE DIVOLA: You people make me sick.
        JERRY: That is one angry clown!

        COMEDY CLUB

        JERRY: The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be 
        that
        you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", 
        "I'm not
        working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's 
        a clown!".
        How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want 
        to
        be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, 
        it's
        actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done.
        Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around 
        them,
        is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this 
        guys
        Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"

        END OF ACT 2


        JERRY: (Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the
        heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
        ELAINE: You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes
        from bugs bunny cartoons.
        JERRY: Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look Im
        serious, Im not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
        JOE DIVOLA: I don't want any money.
        ELAINE: I smell cherry.
        JOE DIVOLA: It's Binaca.
        JERRY: Binaca?

        They see the real clown singing and realize that they are talking to Crazy
        Joe. They run away.

        ALLEYWAY

        George is finalizing the deal.

        GEORGE: What did we say? Two seventy-five?
        MAN#3: Two fifty.

        SUSAN: Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in
        Philadelphia.
        GEORGE: So what, they dont have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
        SUSAN: She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
        GEORGE: Yeah you made it, how about that.
        SUSAN: Oh, Im so excited, now we get to see the opera together.

        George gives the man the ticket and takes the money.

        GEORGE: We get to go to the opera together!
        SUSAN: Who's that?
        GEORGE: Thats-thats-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and 
        he's
        a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.

        JERRY: Come on, you gotta let us in
        USHER: Not without tickets.
        JERRY: We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.

        JERRY: Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.

        JERRY: She's playing, Pagliaccis wife, Nedda.
        ELAINE: Nedda?
        JERRY: Yeah.
        ELAINE: Oh my god..

        Man #3 enters and shuffles to his seat.

        MAN#3: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

        Susan comes in from the other side.

        JERRY: Susan! What are you doing here?
        SUSAN: My Friend's flight couldnt make it.
        JERRY: Where's George?
        MAN#3: I got his ticket.
        SUSAN: He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
        JERRY: Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you
        something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
        MAN#3: One seventy-five.
        JERRY: Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?
        KRAMER: Some nut in a clown suit!

        The show starts, everyone claps except Elaine and Jerry who look very
        frightened.

        COMEDY CLUB

        JERRY: I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how
        they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need
        binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can 
        spot
        'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty,
        three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have
        like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you
        can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe
        thats more you're thing.



        Opening monologue.

        What are lawyers, really? To me a lawyer is basically the person that 
        knows the
        rules of the country. We're all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving 
        our
        pieces around the board, but if there's a problem, the lawyer is the only 
        person
        that has read the inside of the top of the box. I think one of the fun 
        things
        for them is to say, "objection." "Objection! Objection, 
        your Honor." 
        Objection, of course, is the adult version of, "Fraid not." 
        To which the judge
        can say two things, he can say, "overruled" which is the adult 
        version of "Fraid
        so," or he could say, "sustained," which is the adult version 
        of "Duh."


        First scene.
        George is at the counter at Monk's, he's talking with an Oriental woman.

        George: So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?

        Cheryl: Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.

        George: What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?

        Cheryl (laughing): Are your friends as funny as you?

        George: No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm 
        the
        funny one. El Clowno.

        Quick pan to the front door as Jerry and Elaine are entering.

        Elaine: Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you

        Jerry: Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.

        Elaine: It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.

        Jerry: Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk 
        mail,
        there is no mail. 

        Cut back to George and Cheryl at the counter.

        Cheryl: Here's my card.

        George: Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.

        Cheryl: Nice meeting you.

        George: Yeah.

        Cheryl leaves, George walks over to the booth to meet Jerry and Elaine.

        Elaine: Hi!

        Jerry: Hey, how ya doin?

        George: You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you 
        and
        this woman was sitting at the counter.

        Elaine: What, the one who just left?

        George: Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's
        incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything 
        I
        said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. 
        I
        started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no 
        place to
        go.

        Elaine: Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.

        Jerry (looking behind the counter): Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking 
        over)
        Hey, Babu!

        Babu: Jerry!

        Jerry: Look at you, you got the job.

        Babu: Yes, yes, they give me job thanks to you.

        Jerry: Oh, I didn't do anything.

        Babu: Yes, you do everything, get me job, you get me a place to live in 
        your
        building.

        Jerry: Come on.

        Babu: You very very good man, you do everything for me. My family and 
        I can
        never thank you enough for everything you do.

        Cut back to George and Elaine.

        George: You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, 
        now I
        have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? 
        They
        don't want real, they want funny.

        Elaine: No they don't.

        George: Ooooh, yes they do.

        Elaine: Nooo.

        George: Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. 
        You
        always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go 
        for a
        better looking guy with more money.

        Elaine nods her head in approval.

        George: You mean that's true, I'm right?!

        Jerry: Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.

        Babu: Oh, yes, yes, everything wonderful.

        Jerry: Ok, I'll see you around the building.

        Babu: I'll see you *in* the building.

        Jerry (returning to the table): Remember Babu Bhatt?

        George: Who's he?

        Jerry: Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from 
        the
        building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should 
        make it
        into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, 
        going
        with me to the auto show with me Saturday?

        Elaine: Yeah, yeah.

        Jerry: Can you bring my mail then?


        George: What mail?

        Elaine: I picked up his mail while he was on the road

        George: Why didn't Kramer pick it up?

        Jerry: Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.

        George: Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?

        Jerry: Monday, I think.

        George: Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. 
        
        People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. 
        Do
        nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors 
        and have
        sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.

        Jerry: Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't 
        you have
        dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if 
        you want,
        you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.

        George has a dream sequence where the four of them are at a dinner table 
        and
        Cheryl is laughing hysterically at one of Jerry's jokes.

        Jerry: ...he never heard of corduroy!

        Cheryl (howling with laughter): Stop it, you're killing me!!

        Jerry: He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.

        Dream sequence ends.

        George: No, no I don't think so.

        Elaine: Why?

        George: Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.

        Jerry: I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play 
        a zone.

        George: She might not be comfortable.

        Elaine: Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.

        Jerry: We'll be funny.

        George: No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.

        Elaine: Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's
        probably around seven.

        Jerry: No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.

        Elaine: Why?

        Jerry: No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.


        New scene.
        George and Cheryl are at Isabella's.

        George (tasting the wine): Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking
        about.

        Cheryl laughs.

        George: Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start 
        the
        day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.

        Just then the headwaiter seats Jerry and Elaine at the next table.

        Jerry: Look who's here! Georgie-boy!

        What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?

        Elaine: No, I talked him into it.

        George: What happened to the auto show?

        Jerry: Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes 
        model.

        Elaine: The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige 
        to
        propel you well into the 21st century.

        Jerry and Cheryl laugh, George, unamused, tries pushing Jerry and Elaine 
        away
        from their table.

        Elaine (to Cheryl, who's rising to shake her outstretched hand): Hi.

        George: Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry.

        Jerry (shaking hands in turn): Hi, nice to meet you.

        Cheryl: Would you like to join us?

        George: Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.

        Cheryl: Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.

        Elaine: Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?

        George (as the others are repositioning the tables): No, no, you can't 
        do that,
        they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.

        Elaine: Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--

        George: No! No.

        Elaine: No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?

        George (interrupting): You know we should really order, the service is 
        so slow
        here, by the time you get anything...

        Elaine: Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.

        Cheryl: Oh? What happened?

        Elaine: Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against 
        the
        light and I knocked over the delivery boy.

        Cheryl: Was he Chinese?

        Elaine: Yeah.

        Cheryl: Is your last name Benes?

        Jerry: How did you know?

        Cheryl: Ping is my cousin! 

        Elaine: No!

        Jerry: That's so funny!

        Cheryl: I'm handling his case!

        Elaine: What? You're Cheryl Fong?

        Cheryl: That's right!

        By now, they're all laughing.

        Elaine: Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!

        Cheryl: Yeah, I know!

        Elaine: Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to 
        win the
        case?

        Cheryl: Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.

        Elaine: Tell Ping I said hello.

        Jerry: Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.

        They all laugh as Cheryl walks away.

        George (suddenly not laughing): What are you doing? What are you doing?

        Jerry: What?

        George: This is not good. This is not good.

        Jerry: What's the matter?

        George: I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.

        Jerry: Why not?

        Elaine: He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.

        Jerry: Biff?

        George: What?

        Jerry: You're not worried about that?

        George: No, of course not.

        Jerry: I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?

        Elaine: He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll 
        walk
        out on his show, go see the other show. 


        Jerry: Well, should we leave?

        George: Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you 
        not to
        be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm 
        very
        funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be 
        a short
        bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.

        Elaine: This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?

        Jerry: I don't have to be funny, I don't care.

        George: You don't?

        Jerry: No way! It's completely under my control.

        Elaine: No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.

        Jerry: Of course I can, am I being funny now?

        Elaine: A little.

        Jerry: Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?

        Elaine: Yeah.

        Jerry: George, is this funny?

        George: It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so 
        funny
        either.

        Elaine: What? What did I do?

        Cheryl returns.

        George: Hi.

        Jerry (subdued, almost somber): Hello. Welcome back.

        Cheryl: Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal 
        about
        it.

        Elaine: Well, nobody likes to get old, right?

        Jerry: Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone 
        by and
        how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a 
        better
        self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know 
        it's not
        to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is 
        who we are
        to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.

        George: Funny guy, huh?


        New scene.
        Elaine is bringing Jerry's mail to his apartment.

        Elaine: Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.

        Jerry: Well thank you very much, it's about time.

        Elaine: Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case 
        against
        me.

        Jerry: Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.

        Elaine: Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.

        Jerry (leafing through his mail): Oh great, a birth announcement from 
        Arnie and
        Joy Harris.

        They hear a noise from the hallway.

        Jerry: Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!

        Kramer: Hey.

        Jerry: I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.

        Kramer: Well, the camp ended a few days early.

        Jerry: Why?

        Kramer: Uh, well there was an incident.

        Jerry: What happened?

        Kramer: I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.

        Jerry: What?

        Kramer: Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then 
        they
        canceled the rest of the week.

        Elaine: You punched who in the mouth?

        Kramer: Mickey Mantle.

        Jerry: What happened?

        Kramer: Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching,
        and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and 
        man that
        guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.

        Jerry: Wow! Joe Pepitone!

        Kramer: Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. 
        So I
        throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right 
        on his
        pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch,
        he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.

        Jerry: You plunked him.

        Kramer: Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the
        mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks 
        out
        between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and 
        as I'm
        trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody 
        pulls
        me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked 
        down,
        and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.

        Jerry: Wow, this is incredible!

        A voice is heard from the hallway.

        Babu: Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!

        Jerry: What's going on out there?

        Babu: What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very 
        bad
        mistake, very bad.

        Jerry: Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.

        Elaine (to Kramer): Yeah, so?

        Kramer: Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! 
        What have
        you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"

        Elaine: So what'd you do?

        Kramer: Well, I got the hell out of there. 

        Jerry (running back in): They took Babu away!

        Elaine: They took Babu away?!

        Jerry: Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu,
        everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. 
        What
        a shame.

        Babu (calling from the street): Jerry! Jerry! Help me!

        Jerry: I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!

        Kramer: Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over 
        third
        base and knocks over Clete Boyer.

        Jerry (thumbing through his mail): Uh oh.

        Elaine: What?

        Jerry: Well this is interesting.

        Elaine: What is it?

        Jerry: It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal
        application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.

        Kramer: Well, doesn't he need that?


        New scene.
        Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment.

        Jerry: If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole 
        thing
        never would have happened.


        Elaine: Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.

        Jerry: Yeah, so am I being funny now?

        Elaine: No, actually, you're not being funny now.

        Jerry: See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey
        George, look, I'm not funny now.

        George: No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got 
        us both
        so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.

        Jerry: Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, 
        his
        Visa's expired.

        George: What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.

        Jerry: Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.

        George: Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.

        Jerry: Ah, will you stop it already?

        George: Jerry, please?

        Jerry: How long is this gonna go on?

        George: Till I'm comfortable.

        Jerry: Well, when is that gonna be?

        George: After consummation.

        Jerry: Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.


        New scene.
        Jerry and Cheryl are at the coffee shop.

        Cheryl: I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes 
        me a
        big favor. You're very lucky.

        Jerry (somber): That's wonderful news. Thank you.

        Cheryl: You're a very serious person, aren't you?

        Jerry: Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it 
        doesn't
        seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.

        Cheryl: I understand.

        Jerry reaches for the milk for his coffee.

        Cheryl: I think it's curdled.

        Jerry: I don't care.

        Cheryl: Do you ever laugh?

        Jerry: Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.

        Cheryl: That's so sad. What do you do?

        Jerry: I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've
        been so helpful.

        Elaine (entering as Jerry heads to the register): Hey, we're gonna go 
        see Babu
        now, right?

        Jerry: Yeah, I'll just pay for this.

        Elaine: Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) 
        
        Hi.

        Cheryl: Hi.

        Elaine: Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping 
        to drop
        the case.

        Cheryl: Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through
        with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.

        Elaine (laughing): You're kidding.

        Cheryl (laughing): No, I'm not.


        New scene.
        Jerry and Elaine are at the Immigration office.

        Jerry: Babu!

        Babu: Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry!

        Jerry: You remember Elaine.

        Babu: Yes, yes of course!

        Elaine: Nice to meet you.

        Babu: So nice of you both to come.

        Jerry: Oh, Babu.

        Babu: No no, you're both very kind, very kind.

        Jerry and Elaine (in unison): Oh, well, you know.

        Elaine: We try.

        Jerry: We do what we can.

        Elaine: We do what we can.

        Babu: The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was
        expecting it.

        Jerry: Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I 
        was
        away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.

        Babu: Comedy shows! You're a very funny man.

        Jerry: Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because 
        you
        know that little box can get very full.

        Babu: Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I 
        would
        have picked up your mail, your box is right next to mine.

        Jerry: Oh, I don't want to bother you.

        Babu: No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good 
        man.

        Jerry: So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and 
        I
        noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail 
        box.

        Babu: Come again?

        Jerry: You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my 
        mail
        until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.

        Elaine: Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.

        Babu: You had my Visa application?!

        Jerry: Well not technically.

        Babu (extremely and suddenly agitated): I kill you!!

        Jerry: Well what about her?

        Babu: I kill both of you!!

        Jerry: Babu?!

        Babu: No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad
        man!

        Jerry: Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone 
        in
        the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, 
        the
        wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!

        Babu: The wheels are in motion?

        Jerry: The wheels are in motion, things are happening!


        New scene.
        George and Cheryl are parked.

        George: Jerry?

        Cheryl: I'm very attracted to him.

        George: You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even 
        close
        to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.

        Cheryl: He never said anything funny.

        George: He can't not be funny.

        Cheryl: No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.

        George: Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and

        cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was 
        funnier. 
        That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You 
        can't
        find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on 
        trees? 
        Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.

        Cheryl: So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?

        George: Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that 
        needs
        help.

        Cheryl: I gotta go.

        George: Well, should I call you later?

        Cheryl: Please don't.

        George: But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it
        all!!


        New scene.
        Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment.

        Elaine: So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?

        Jerry: I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take 
        care
        of it, he should be back by now. (Answering the buzzer) Yeah?

        George: It's George.

        Jerry: C'mon up.

        They hear a voice in the hallway, Jerry opens the door.

        Jerry: Babu must be back.

        Babu's Brother: Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?

        Jerry: Where's Babu?

        Babu's Brother: He is in Pakistan!

        Jerry: Who are you?

        Babu's Brother: I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to 
        be
        fixed.

        Jerry: I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.

        Babu's Brother: Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!

        Elaine (offering a drink): Snapple?

        Babu's Brother: No, too fruity.

        Babu's Brother leaves, George enters.

        Jerry: Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his 
        Visa.

        George: She didn't help him?

        Jerry: No.

        George: Where is he?

        Jerry: He's in Pakistan.

        George: Oh boy.

        Jerry: What do you mean, oh boy?

        George: Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the
        disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.

        Jerry: Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.

        George: What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.

        Jerry: That's because she had my mail.

        Kramer enters.

        Elaine: Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone 
        to
        that fantasy camp.

        Kramer: Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.

        Jerry: How could you go in there?

        Kramer: Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle,
        my idol. It was eating me up inside!

        Jerry: Well, what happened?

        Kramer: I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. 
        I'm
        begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, 
        I love
        you!"

        Elaine: So, what did he do?

        Kramer: Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they 
        threw me
        outside, right into a horse.

        There's a knock on Kramer's door.

        Voice: Kramer?

        Kramer: Yeah? It's my Chinese food.

        Ping enters with a bag of food.

        Elaine: Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit
        against me.

        Ping: Not anymore.

        Elaine: What?

        Ping: Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on.

        Elaine: Why?

        Ping: She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? 
        Wait
        till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. 
        She
        never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta 
        la
        vista, baby.

        Ping exits.


        New scene.
        Babu and a friend are sitting at a table in an outdoor cafe in Pakistan.

        Babu: So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then 
        he
        came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels 
        were
        in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent 
        me
        back here.

        Babu's Friend: This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do?

        Babu: I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America,
        and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. 
        He
        haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man.


        Closing monologue.

        I am for open immigration but that sign we have on the front of the Statue 
        of
        Liberty, 'Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses...', can't 
        we just
        say, 'Hey, the door's open, we'll take whoever you got.'? Do we have to 
        specify
        the wretched refuse? I mean, why don't we just say, 'Give us the unhappy, 
        the
        sad, the slow, the ugly, people that can't drive, that they have trouble
        merging, if they can't stay in their lane, if they don't signal, they 
        can't
        parallel park, if they're sneezing, if they're stuffed up, if they're 
        clogged,
        if they have bad penmanship, don't return calls, if they have dandruff, 
        food
        between their teeth, if they have bad credit, if they have no credit, 
        missed a
        spot shaving, in other words any dysfunctional defective slob that you 
        can
        somehow cattle prod onto a wagon, send them over, we want 'em.'

        SEINFELD Episode no. 56 "The Shoes" (Original air date 4 Feb 
        1993)

        Directed by Tom Cherones. Written by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld.

        Guest stars: Bob Balaban (Russell)
            Gina Hecht (Dana)
            Anita Barone (Gail)
        Denise Richards (Molly)
        Michael Ornstein (Waiter)


        Jerry's opening monologue: The basic problem with the beginning of the 
        relationship, I think, is that each person has their own sexual time-table 
        of what should happen when, that the other person knows nothing about. 
        That's why I really think we need some sort of sexual rulebook, where 
        it's written down and agreed upon - sexual, standard, dating procedure. 
        Know what I mean? So if there's any problems, you can go, <takes a 
        small booklet out of his inside pocket> "Look, honey, I'm very 
        sorry, but we've been out three times, and according to Article 7, Section 
        5, there's got to be some physical contact, as you can see." <Gestures 
        to the booklet.> "Otherwise, I will report you to the board, and 
        they can put out a warrant for an embrace."


        Commercial break.

        Opening scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment, working on the 
        script for the "Jerry" pilot episode.

        GEORGE (writing on a notepad): Wait a second, wait a second...and then 
        the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"

        JERRY (copying it down and grinning): That's funny, that's funny! "I'm 
        sick of cleaning." That's very funny.

        GEORGE (laughing): I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!

        JERRY: Yeah, it's funny!

        GEORGE: I mean, how funny is this?

        JERRY (low voice): It's funny.

        GEORGE: I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!

        JERRY: It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta 
        finish this today.

        GEORGE: Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist 
        to read. She's smart, I trust her.

        JERRY: Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.

        GEORGE: Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the 
        show yet. We should try and get her into this scene.

        JERRY: Right, right. Okay. <Writing> Elaine enters. <Thinks> 
        What does she say...?

        GEORGE (thinking): I don't know, what do women say?

        JERRY: I don't know.

        GEORGE: I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.

        JERRY: You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people 
        to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's 
        standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.

        GEORGE: Alright, forget Elaine.

        JERRY: Alright. <They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer 
        enters.>

        KRAMER: Hey.

        GEORGE: Hey.

        JERRY: Hey.

        KRAMER (to Jerry): You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.

        JERRY: Who?

        KRAMER: Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.

        JERRY: Did you talk to her?

        KRAMER: Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? 
        I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with 
        her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking, what is 
        my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I ignore her? I mean, what 
        is my responsibility here?

        JERRY: So what happened?

        KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, <imitates Gail> 
        "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she 
        never went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.

        JERRY: Yeah, I know about the three dates.

        KRAMER: You know what I did? I snubbed her. 

        JERRY: What do you mean, you snubbed her?

        KRAMER: I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.

        JERRY (smiling): Right by her?

        KRAMER: Right by her! 

        JERRY (to George, hugs Kramer happily): What you do say about a guy like 
        this, huh! <George applauds.> You are some great friend, I tell 
        ya, snubbed her! <seriously> Not that I condone it. I've never condoned 
        snubbing in my administration. Your loyalty is beyond question. 

        KRAMER: Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda 
        been a lot worse.


        New scene - Jerry and Elaine at the coffee shop. Jerry is showing her 
        the script.

        ELAINE (throws the script at Jerry): I'm not even in here!

        JERRY: Yeah, I know. 

        ELAINE: I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes. 
        

        JERRY: Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep 
        track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...

        ELAINE: You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?

        JERRY: Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...<confessing> 
        ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even 
        right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have 
        no idea what it is. 

        ELAINE: You have no idea?

        JERRY: Something derogatory? <Gail enters the coffee shop and walks 
        over to the booth.>

        GAIL (to Jerry): I thought I'd find you here.

        JERRY: Well, Gail Cunningham.

        ELAINE: Hi, Gail.

        GAIL: Hi, Elaine. <To Jerry> Hey, what is with your friend Kramer? 
        

        JERRY: Why?

        GAIL: He snubbed me. 

        JERRY: Are you sure?

        GAIL: Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?

        JERRY: Nothing. <Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take 
        a bite.> Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. <Takes back 
        the sandwich.>

        ELAINE: I thought you were finished.

        JERRY: I took two bites, how am I finished? <Elaine coughs.> Plus 

        you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? <Offers 
        Gail the sandwich> Bite?

        GAIL: So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?

        JERRY: I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.

        GAIL: Well, tell him that I am mad at him.

        JERRY: Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?

        GAIL: Pfeiffer's.

        JERRY: Ah, the power lunch crowd.

        GAIL (to Elaine): Nice shoes! 

        ELAINE: Oh. Thank you.

        GAIL: Where'd you get 'em?

        ELAINE (modest): They're um, Botticelli's.

        GAIL (impressed): Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in 
        there.

        ELAINE: Really.

        JERRY: Would you care to join us?

        GAIL: No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. <Looks at her watch.> 
        Oh! See ya. <Exits.>

        JERRY: See ya.

        ELAINE (irritated, imitates Gail): "Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's." 
        

        JERRY: That bothered you?

        ELAINE: Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, 
        I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.

        JERRY: It did?

        ELAINE: Yes! Couldn't you see that?

        JERRY (thinks): No. This is why you're not in the pilot.


        New scene - George in a session with Dana, his therapist.

        DANA: Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on 
        things. I think we're making progress.

        GEORGE: Yeah, I feel like I've grown.

        DANA: Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.

        GEORGE: Great. <They both stand.> Oh, by the way, did you get a 
        chance to read the script?

        DANA: Yes, yes I did.

        GEORGE (beaming): Well, what'd you think?

        DANA (unenthusiastic): Uh...it was...good.

        GEORGE: You didn't like it?

        DANA: Well, no, I - 

        GEORGE: I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you 
        like about it?

        DANA: It wasn't funny.

        GEORGE: It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?

        DANA: No, I didn't find it funny.

        GEORGE: You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?

        DANA: Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, 
        doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? 
        I didn't really buy that.

        GEORGE: Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...we pitched this story to 
        Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.

        DANA: George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going 
        to have to learn how to deal with criticism.

        GEORGE: How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? 
        You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea 
        of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.

        DANA: I think you'd better go.

        GEORGE: Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' <Heads for the door, then stops.> 
        It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control 
        freak!


        New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment. They're both standing 
        by the door. Elaine enters.

        GEORGE (immediately, to Elaine): So, you send me to this therapist to 
        help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. <Tosses 
        the script to Jerry.> What kind of a therapist is that?

        ELAINE: I guess she didn't think it was funny.

        GEORGE: Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? 
        We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my 
        confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee! 

        JERRY: I thought your mother's paying for it.

        GEORGE: And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be 
        able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still 
        a good person."

        JERRY (to Elaine): You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize 
        the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told 
        me.

        ELAINE: What did I think of it? <Manufactures a cough instead of answering. 
        Kramer enters.> 

        KRAMER (to Jerry): Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. <Elaine 
        runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.>

        JERRY (catches Elaine): Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. 
        C'mon, tell me what you thought.

        ELAINE: Well, you know, I...

        KRAMER: I just kissed Gail Cunningham. <Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, 
        shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.>

        JERRY: You what?

        KRAMER: Yeah, I kissed her.

        JERRY: You kissed her?

        KRAMER: Right on the mouth.

        JERRY: What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to 
        kissing?

        KRAMER: Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she 
        started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little 
        bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my 
        arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! 
        <Laughs.>

        JERRY: And what did she do?

        KRAMER: She kissed me back.

        JERRY: I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't 
        want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?

        KRAMER (realizing): Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! 
        Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!

        GEORGE: No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. 
        Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. <Elaine 
        returns from the bathroom.>

        KRAMER (to Elaine): Ooh, so...I understand you're buying new shoes now 
        at Botticelli's.

        ELAINE: What? Who told you that?

        KRAMER: Gail Cunningham.

        ELAINE: I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? 
        Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?

        KRAMER: Well, you know, we were just talking, and she mentioned how you're 
        buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.

        ELAINE (angrily): "How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" 
        Did you hear this? <Shoves Jerry and Kramer.>

        JERRY: So what?

        ELAINE: So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my 
        shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! <Storms over to 
        the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine 
        from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...>


        New scene - Gail cooking in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's Restaurant. Elaine 
        marches in.

        ELAINE: Hey! Gail!


        GAIL: Elaine...!

        ELAINE: Why are you talking about my shoes?

        GAIL: What?

        ELAINE: My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.

        GAIL: What are you talking about?

        ELAINE: Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? 
        <A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.>

        WAITER: Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?

        GAIL: Look Elaine, I am very busy here.

        ELAINE: Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why 
        my footwear is your conversation!

        GAIL: I am not discussing this. This is insane.

        WAITER: You got that pasta primavera? Let's go! <Gail passes the plate 
        to the waiter in front of Elaine. Elaine sneezes on it. The waiter brings 
        the pasta to the dining room and serves it to Russell Dalrymple, the president 
        of NBC.> Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.

        RUSSELL: Thank you.

        WAITER: Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch.


        New scene - Jerry and George arrive at Dalrymple's apartment to discuss 
        the script.

        RUSSELL (opening the door): Well, come in. <They shake hands.> Awfully 
        sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough 
        to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet 
        with you this week.

        JERRY: Are you alright?

        RUSSELL: Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something 
        in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.

        JERRY: Where did you eat?

        RUSSELL: Pfeiffer's. 

        JERRY: Ah. I know the chef there.

        RUSSELL: Yeah. The food's usually terrific.

        GEORGE: My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base 
        for a toilet. <Jerry and Russell are shocked.> 

        RUSSELL: What are you saying?

        GEORGE: Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you 
        go in there - stick with the consumee.

        RUSSELL: Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here 
        soon.

        JERRY: Oh, you have a daughter?

        RUSSELL: Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.

        GEORGE: Aw, that's a fun age. <Jerry looks at George distastefully.>

        RUSSELL: Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and 
        everytime I read it...<looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.>

        JERRY: What?

        RUSSELL: Excuse me for a second. <Gets up and runs to the bathroom.>

        GEORGE: Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! <Russell 
        goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.> (To Jerry) Do you think 
        he liked it? <From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving 
        his guts.> 

        JERRY: I'm not sure. <The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the 
        bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.> What was that 
        dish he said he had...?

        GEORGE: Pasta primavera.

        JERRY: Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.' 

        GEORGE: No!

        JERRY: Yeah. 

        RUSSELL (coming out of the bathroom): Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, 
        uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.

        GEORGE: So, you were saying how, um...about the script...

        RUSSELL: Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...<looks 
        nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.>

        GEORGE: More jokes?

        JERRY: Another ending?

        GEORGE: A different name for the butler? <Russell throws up again.>

        JERRY: Maybe we should go. 

        GEORGE: We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about 
        our work. <Russell throws up yet again.>

        RUSSELL (from bathroom): Oh God. Oh my god. 

        JERRY: I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. 
        <Russell's daughter Molly enters.>

        MOLLY: Hello.

        JERRY: Hi.

        GEORGE: Hi.

        MOLLY: I'm Molly.

        JERRY: I'm Jerry.

        GEORGE: George. 

        JERRY: We're here discussing our script with your father. 

        GEORGE: He just read it. <Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look 
        ashamed.>

        MOLLY: Daddy? Are you okay? 

        RUSSELL (from bathroom): Yeah, sweetie. I'm fine. <Molly sits on the 
        back of the chair.>

        GEORGE: So, you live with your mother, huh?

        MOLLY: Uh, yeah.

        GEORGE (to Jerry): Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid. Of 
        course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never 
        know. <Russell comes out of the bathroom.>

        MOLLY: Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?

        RUSSELL: It's just a stomach thing.

        MOLLY: Yuck. 

        RUSSELL (to Jerry and George): We're going to have to do this some other 
        time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. <Jerry 
        and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.>

        GEORGE: You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. 
        <Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends 
        over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, 
        hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.>

        RUSSELL (angrily): Get a good look, Costanza?


        New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.

        JERRY: What were you doing?

        GEORGE: Well, it's not my fault. You poked me! 

        JERRY: You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like 
        you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the 
        Empire State Building.

        GEORGE: It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win 
        an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.

        JERRY: Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare 
        at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.

        GEORGE: All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who 
        wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.

        JERRY: That's why I poked.

        GEORGE: That's why I peeked. <Jerry opens the door to take some trash 
        out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.>

        GAIL: Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?

        JERRY: What?

        GAIL: She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts 
        complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.

        KRAMER: Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.


        GAIL: I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have 
        sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten 
        sick because of her. <Kramer and Gail exit.>

        GEORGE: Pasta primavera?

        JERRY: Is that what she said? <Kramer pokes his head back in the door.>

        KRAMER (to Jerry): She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' 
        me out.

        JERRY: She is?

        KRAMER: She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. <Kramer 
        grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag 
        to George.>

        JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi Stu.

        GEORGE (lazily swinging the garbage bag around): From NBC?

        JERRY: Yeah. What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you 
        a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. <hangs up.> Dalrymple 
        just cancelled the pilot. <George drops the bag, shocked.>


        Commercial break.

        New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.

        JERRY (to Elaine): If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never 
        would have happened.

        ELAINE: Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, 
        okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking 
        at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!

        GEORGE: He poked me!

        JERRY: There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - <mimics nudging 
        someone with an elbow> - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...

        ELAINE: But she was fifteen.

        JERRY: You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on 
        a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird 
        fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.

        GEORGE: Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't 
        take our calls, we can't get into his office...

        JERRY: You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? 
        We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there 
        and talk to him.

        GEORGE: Hey, now you're onto something.

        JERRY: The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing 
        if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.

        GEORGE: Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine, but...somebody like Gail, though.

        ELAINE: What? What do you mean, Gail? <Kramer enters.>

        KRAMER: Yah-hey.

        JERRY: Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next 
        time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call 
        me. 

        KRAMER: Alright, I'll call her right now. <Kramer goes back to his 
        apartment.>

        ELAINE (to George): What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract 
        attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?

        JERRY: Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... 
        <Kramer comes back.>

        KRAMER: She said she'll do it.

        JERRY: Beautiful.

        KRAMER (points at Elaine's feet): But she wants the shoes.

        ELAINE: What?

        KRAMER: She says she wants those shoes.

        ELAINE: She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She 
        is not getting 'em!

        JERRY: No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!

        ELAINE: No, these were the last pair of these that they had! 

        JERRY: I'll get you another one just like it!

        ELAINE: No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't 
        you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? <Jerry, 
        realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.>

        GEORGE (to Elaine, in a somber tone): Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't 
        matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been 
        over to the hospital to see her...

        ELAINE: Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -

        GEORGE: Never mind! 

        ELAINE: Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How 
        do I even know she wears the same size?

        KRAMER: Alright, what size are you?

        ELAINE: Seven-and-a-half.

        KRAMER: Eh! Bingo.


        New scene - Gail in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's. She notices Dalrymple being 
        shown to his table.

        GAIL (hands a plate to another chef): Sauce this. <Goes to the telephone 
        and dials.> Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. 
        <Hangs up.>

        Continuation of last scene - Russell eating at the restaurant. Jerry and 
        George arrive. Jerry hands the shoes to Gail, and they walk over to Russell's 
        table.

        JERRY: Hey! Whattaya know!

        GEORGE: Look who's here!

        JERRY: Fancy meeting you here!

        RUSSELL: Oh. Hello.

        GEORGE (notices Russell's lunch): Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.

        JERRY: You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, 
        we hadn't heard from you.

        GEORGE: Didn't hear anything... 

        JERRY: Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.

        RUSSELL: It just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. 
        <Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as 
        she moves to the table opposite Russell.> So, what were you saying?

        GEORGE: Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you 
        perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue 
        with that. I did not leer. <To Jerry> Did I leer?

        JERRY: No leer. <Elaine comes over to Russell's table.>

        ELAINE (to Russell): Excuse me, are you using that ketchup?

        RUSSELL (not noticing Elaine's cleavage): Uh, no. <Elaine takes the 
        ketchup and goes back to her table.>

        GEORGE: Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my 
        field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. <Elaine loudly snaps 
        and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.>

        RUSSELL: Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be 
        in business together. <Elaine comes back over.>

        ELAINE: Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying 
        to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom 
        of it. Do you have any trouble?

        RUSSELL (still not noticing Elaine's cleavage): No.

        ELAINE (leaning forward): Do you have a...ketchup secret?

        RUSSELL: No, I... <finally notices Elaine>...don't have a ketchup 
        secret. <Smiles.>

        ELAINE (flirtatiously): Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would 
        really, really like to know what it is. <Russell is pleased, and smiles 
        at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.>

        RUSSELL (to Jerry and George, reconsidering about the pilot): Field of 
        vision, huh?


        Commercial break.

        New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine having dinner at Pfeiffer's. Gail 
        comes over to the table.

        GAIL: How's everything? 

        ELAINE: Mmmm.

        JERRY: Really good.


        GEORGE: This pasta primavera is fabulous.

        JERRY: Very tasty.

        GAIL: How'd everything go with that NBC guy?

        GEORGE: Great. 

        JERRY: The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow 
        night. <Gail nods and walks away.> Listen, Elaine, if Russell mentions 
        anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked 
        it...?

        ELAINE: You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, 
        uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing 
        a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.

        JERRY: Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.

        ELAINE: Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.

        GEORGE: Well, it's a funny idea.

        JERRY: It's funny!

        GEORGE: C'mon, funny is funny.

        JERRY: Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?

        ELAINE: Well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.

        JERRY: If you can.

        GEORGE: Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?

        ELAINE: Bouchard's, on 53rd. <George starts choking on his wine, and 
        attempts to tell Elaine something.>

        JERRY: I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." 
        <George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.>

        [At the comedy club]

        Jerry: I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the 
        bachelor party and the 
        bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's 
        getting the lingerie, he'd be at 
        a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. 
        But to me, the 
        difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. 
        You see, when you're 
        single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. 
        I can give the order to fall 
        asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can 
        overrule me! When you're 
        married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets 
        done there are meetings. 
        Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. 
        That's what's so painful 
        about divorce: you get impeached and you're not even the president!

        [Jerry's apartment]

        George: Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk 
        a lot faster than 
        everybody else?

        Elaine: We don't walk that fast...

        George: No seriously...

        Elaine: Seriously, we don't.

        George: The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see 
        they out there on the 
        street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on 
        their ass.

        Elaine: (Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. 
        We're gonna miss the 
        previews!

        Jerry (coming out of the bathroom): What's the big hurry?

        Elaine: Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?

        Jerry: Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.

        George: I gotta buy a present now?

        Elaine: Of course you do, it's an engagement party.

        George: It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they 
        get married, you gonna 
        have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. 
        Then the baby starts 
        getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.

        Jerry: You don't like the Drake?

        George: Hate the Drake.

        Elaine: I *love* the Drake.

        Jerry: How could you not like the Drake?

        George: Who's the Drake?

        Elaine: "Who's the Drake"?

        Jerry: The Drake is good!

        Elaine: So listen, what are you gonna get him?

        George: I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)

        Jerry: Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's 
        perfect!

        Elaine: So what? That's easy.

        Jerry: Easy?

        (Kramer enters in his usual way)

        Elaine: Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?

        Kramer: Uh, no, no, not yet.

        Jerry: Do you like the Drake?

        Kramer: I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!

        Elaine: I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.

        Kramer: (Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...

        Jerry: It's Isosceles

        Kramer: Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would 
        name him Isosceles. 
        Isosceles Kramer.

        Elaine: Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.

        Jerry: The chip-in!

        Elaine: Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?

        Jerry: Yeah!

        Kramer: Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!

        Jerry: You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we 
        go to the party. We'll have 
        to take your car, it's got the most room.

        Kramer: No, no! My car's not running.

        (George enters the room from the washroom)

        Jerry: What about your father's car?

        George: No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's 
        got the good spot in front 
        of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna 
        wanna move.

        Jerry: Are you serious?

        George: You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he 
        doesn't go out for weeks. 

        Jerry: How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold 
        the good spot in front of 
        the good building, and we can get the good car!

        George: Good thinking!

        Jerry: Good to meet you!

        [George's car]

        Elaine: So what are we gonna get him?

        Jerry: We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.

        George: I like this area. I could live out here. 

        Kramer: Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.

        Jerry: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you 
        permission to sublet my 
        room right now.

        George: Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse 
        me, are you gettin' out?

        Man in car: No!

        Kramer: Why don't you take a handicap spot...

        George: You think?

        Elaine: No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot. 

        George: I don't want to walk that far.

        Elaine: What if a handicapped person needs it?

        Kramer: Oh, come on, they don't drive!


        Jerry: Yes, they do!

        Kramer: Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and 
        park?

        Jerry: Well there's spaces there, they must drive!

        Kramer: Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.

        Elaine: So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?

        George: Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to 
        the "party"!

        Kramer: I got news for you: handicapped people, they don't even want to 
        park there! They wanna be 
        treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.

        George: He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, 
        they want everything to be 
        equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?

        Elaine: What does that mean?

        George: Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.

        Kramer: Yeah, go ahead.

        Elaine: George!

        George: Oh, come on, it's five minutes.

        (pulls into handicap spot)

        Kramer: Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.

        Jerry, George, Elaine: Don't worry. We won't forget!

        [walking in the parking garage]

        Jerry: Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that 
        price?

        Elaine: What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? 
        We're gonna be swimming 
        in 'thank you's...

        George: What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, 
        so I had to get the veggie 
        burger, I'm allover crums...

        Jerry: No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good 
        for them, love the Drake!

        Elaine: Got to *love* the Drake!

        (sound of police cars)

        Jerry: Hey, what's going on over here?

        Elaine: Must have been an accident...

        (they turn the corner so they can see their car, surrounded by a lot of 
        people)

        Jerry: (to a woman) Hey, what's going on?

        Woman: Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair 
        had to wheel up this 
        incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards 
        into the wall. Taken her to 
        St. Elizabeth's...

        Jerry: Is she OK?

        Woman: I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car 
        to show up. May not get out 
        alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!

        Jerry: Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd 
        like to stick around and 
        get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.

        (man hits George's car in rage)

        George: How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!

        Elaine: (to George) Are you happy now?

        Kramer: Who would think these people we're gonna be here?

        Jerry: I don't know...

        Elaine: What about the party? What about the Drake?

        George: Screw the Drake!

        Jerry: I love the Drake!

        Kramer: Let's just take a bus back to the city.

        George: Can't leave the car here!

        Kramer: Why not?

        George: It's my father's car!

        Man who hit car ealier: Let's smash it!

        Everybody: Yeah! Yeah!

        Jerry: Let's get out of here.

        [coffee shop]

        George: What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?

        Jerry: The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody 
        there, how do we know 
        they're not all hiding, waiting for us?

        Elaine: Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there 
        all night?

        Jerry: What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of 
        the century? It's not like 
        we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...

        George: What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think 
        she'd be able to roll up 
        the hill with her hands!

        Kramer: You'd think...

        George: I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared 
        for that?

        Kramer: Most of them don't even have batteries.

        George: Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't 
        want to do any work, and 
        just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy. 

        Kramer: Yeah...

        George: Well, I'm sorry!

        Elaine: Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...

        George: How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!

        Jerry: I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.

        Elaine: Me?

        Jerry: Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!

        Elaine: Oh, they won't?

        Jerry: Not if they don't know you...

        Elaine: I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!

        Kramer: No chance in hell!

        Jerry: What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went 
        by the car and started 
        screaming: "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" 
        And then, when they all run into 
        the other direction, we'll jump in the car!

        George: That's good, we'll give it a try...

        Elaine: That's good...

        Jerry: That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!

        Kramer: Huh?

        [parking garage]

        (the four of them approach George's car, which is smashed to pieces)

        Jerry: (as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot 
        of these scratches will buff 
        right out... 

        [George's parents' house]

        Frank: Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!

        (Estelle is playing Mahjongh with the ladies)

        Frank: A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!

        George: Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... 
        They were hurling racial 
        epiphates at us... I could have been killed!

        Estelle: (to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!


        Frank: (to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole 
        thing is a total loss!

        Mahjongh lady: Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!

        Frank: No it isn't!

        Mahjongh lady: So what are you doing now, Georgie?

        George: I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC... 

        Frank: Where the hell is my paper?

        Mahjongh lady: You're writing a pilot?

        Estelle: With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...

        Mahjongh lady: So what's it about?

        George: Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any 
        insurance, so the judge 
        sentences him to be Jerry's butler.

        Majongh ladies: This is the same situation! Frank, maybe you ought to 
        make him your butler! 
        (giggling)

        Estelle: Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's 
        a real trouble maker!

        George: Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...

        Estelle: He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was 
        nice... I don't know what 
        happened to him... 

        (Estelle wins at Mahjongh)

        [Jerry's apartment]

        (Jerry's on the phone with the Drake, Elaine is eating an Oreo cookie)

        Jerry: (to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, 
        you're welcome... (to 
        Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!

        Elaine: Oh, yeah...

        Jerry: (to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great 
        idea. (To Elaine) Drake 
        wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since 
        we missed the partly last 
        night, to maybe get something to eat?

        Elaine: Sure!

        Jerry: (to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! 
        ... okay... okay, see you 
        later... bye...

        Jerry: The Drake is great!

        Elaine: Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.

        Jerry: Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad 
        they're happy, but, 
        frankly, that doesn't do anything for me. 

        [buzzer rings]

        Jerry: Yes?

        George: It's me.

        Jerry: Come on up.

        [Door opens, Kramer enters]

        Kramer: Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's. 

        Jerry: St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?

        Kramer: Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.

        Elaine: You went to see her?

        Kramer: Yeah. 

        Jerry: Wow, what happened?

        Kramer: I'm in love. 

        Jerry: What?

        Kramer: Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love 
        her Jerry, I really love 
        her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted 
        in another human being. 
        Except for the walking.

        Jerry: Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.

        [George enters]

        Kramer: Ah, I'm glad you're here. 

        George: What?

        Kramer: Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair. 

        George: A wheelchair? What for?

        Kramer: Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, 
        you know, and the 
        wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!

        George: Doesn't she have collision?

        Kramer: George, I'm in love with her! 

        George: Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can 
        get her one.

        Kramer: No! She needs it now!

        George: What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?

        Kramer: Well...

        Elaine: Hey, we told you not to park there!

        George: Can't we just fix the old one?

        Kramer: Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're 
        gonna be driving along, 
        we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! 
        Is that what you want?

        George: Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement 
        presents.. IT NEVER 
        ENDS!


        [at Surgical Appliances]

        Salesman: This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce 
        of wheelchairs. This is 
        like... you're almost glad to be handicapped.

        Kramer: So now, what's this got?

        Salesman: Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully 
        loaded. I put Stephen 
        Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number 
        one by Hospital Supply and 
        Prosthetic Magazine.

        George: How much?

        Salesman: 6200. 

        George: Do you have something a little more... less expensive?


        [At the Drake's]

        (The Drake opens the door, the Drakette is sitting on the couch)

        Jerry and Elaine: Hey Drake! Hi Drake! 

        Jerry:Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!

        Elaine: My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away 
        or what?

        The Drake: Oh yeah, yeah... it's fantastic...

        (Jerry sits down next to Alison)

        Jerry: I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl 
        here, every big fight....

        Elaine: Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?

        Jerry: So where're we eatin'?

        The Drake: Well, actually... Jerry... 

        Elaine: I'm *really* hungry!

        The Drake: ... we just broke up...

        Jerry: When did this happen?

        The Drake: About 20 minutes ago... Hey, I am really sorry about this guys... 
        whew!

        Jerry (looking at the TV): Look at the picture on this thing...


        Elaine: Oh, cristal clear! 

        Jerry: They know how to make 'em...

        (The Drake starts sobbing)

        Elaine: Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?

        The Drake (through his sobbing): Gagliano's... that's pretty good...

        Jerry: Well... we should... 

        Elaine: Get movin'...

        Jerry: Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the 
        best. 

        Elaine: Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!

        (The Drake is sobbing again, Elaine takes the remote control out the door 
        then returns)

        Elaine: Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...


        [at Surgical Appliances]

        Salesman: Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, 
        it was owned by some lady 
        who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her 
        cat.

        Kramer: But this'll get you around?

        Salesman: Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar.

        George: Like what?

        Salesman: For example, your tremor-damping.

        Kramer: Now what's that?

        Salesman: It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's 
        tremors or spasticity.

        Kramer: Well, is it alright if I try it?

        Salesman: Hop in!

        (Kramer sits down, and likes it)

        Kramer: Oh yeah!

        (Salesman is laughing)

        Salesman: I tell ya...

        (Kramer crashes into wheelchairs while trying to control his)

        Salesman: When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds 
        me why I got into this 
        business in the first place.

        George: How much?

        (Kramer crashes into some more wheelchairs)

        Salesman: How about $240?

        George & Kramer: We'll take it!


        [Jerry's appartment]

        Elaine: Drake gave her the TV?

        Jerry: He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.

        Elaine: Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!

        Jerry: I know it is!

        Elaine: Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!

        Jerry: I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can 
        just get engaged and get 
        presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago 
        tomorrow and do the whole 
        thing all over again.

        Elaine: They don't know anybody in Chicago. 

        Jerry: Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.

        (George enters)

        George: Hey.

        Jerry: Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.

        George (excited): The Drake broke up?! That's fantastic! Now we get the 
        TV back! It'll help defray 
        some of the cost of the wheelchair.

        Jerry: I don't know about defraying. 

        George: Why?

        Jerry: We're not gettin' that TV.

        George: What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's 
        business.

        Elaine: The Drakette took it.

        George: She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no 
        theirs there's no hers, it 
        should be ours. 

        Elaine: Well, she has it!

        George (upset): I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!

        George: Maybe we should call her.

        Elaine: Well, who's gonna call?

        Jerry: You are.

        Elaine: What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?

        Jerry: Because that's your thing!

        Elaine: What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return 
        expensive gifts, that's my 
        "thing"?

        Jerry: Yeah, that's your thing.

        Elaine: Alright, gimme the phone... it's my "thing"...

        (Elaine starts dialling)

        Jerry (to George): You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.

        George: Really?

        Jerry: Yeah. 

        George: I could see that...

        (Alison through phone): Hello?

        Elaine: Alison! Hi, this is Elaine... 

        (Alison through phone): I gave all the gifts to charity.

        Elaine: Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the 
        Drake...

        (Alison though phone): I hate the Drake.

        Elaine: Everybody does. Bye-bye....

        (Elaine hangs up the phone)

        Elaine: She gave it to charity.

        Jerry: Charity?!? That's apalling.

        George: How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!

        (Kramer enters)

        Kramer: Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look 
        on her face. And then she 
        told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you 
        see George, the whole 
        incident was a God blessing! Yeah!

        George: You mean a blessing in disguise?

        Kramer: Yeah....


        [At George's parents' place]

        Lady: And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank 
        Costanza, who has earned 
        the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer 
        Representative of the 
        Month!

        (applause)

        Lady: Due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22,000. That's 
        a lot of wheelchairs!

        (applause, door bel rings)


        Lady: On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank 
        you!

        (Estelle opens the front door, two men walk in)

        Frank: Well... thank you very much!

        Cop: Mr. Costanza?

        Frank: Yes?

        Cop: You're under arrest. 

        Frank: Under arrest? What for?

        Cop: Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic 
        code 342-A.

        Frank: What's that?

        Cop: Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...

        Frank: George! George!


        [Jerry's appartment]

        Jerry: Your father got arrested? For what?

        George: Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United 
        Volunteers meeting. When he 
        got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.

        Jerry: Ho-ly!

        George: Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, 
        there's no way I can 
        ever pay him back...

        Jerry: So what are you gonna do?

        George: I agreed to become his butler.

        Jerry: What?

        (Kramer enters)

        Jerry: What's the matter?

        Kramer: It's over! 

        Jerry: What's over?

        Kramer: Me and Lola....

        George: The woman we bought the wheelchair for?

        Kramer: Yeah, she dumped me! 

        Jerry: She dumped you?

        Kramer: She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster 
        dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?

        Jerry & George (hesitatingly): ... no...

        Kramer: Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, 
        look at me, look at my 
        face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?

        George: ...you're very attractive...

        Kramer: yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop 
        dead!

        Jerry: Drop dead?

        George: Boy, even I never heard that one...

        Jerry: She's pretty rough!

        Kramer: Yeesh-jip!

        George: Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.

        Jerry: 240 bucks?

        George: Well, it was slightly used...

        Jerry: Used?


        [cut to Lola rolling down a hill trying to use her brakes that don't work, 
        screaming]


        [George's parents' place]

        (George's vaccuuming)

        Frank (picking up his shoes): I don't think you did such a good job on 
        these... 

        (George turns off the vaccuum)

        George: What!?

        Frank: You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?

        (Phone rings)

        Frank: Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill 
        huh?
        Okay! Alight! Bye!

        (hangs up the phone)

        Frank: George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me 
        (scribbles something on a 
        piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave 
        her a used wheelchair with 
        defective brakes.

        George: Sons of bitches!

        Frank: Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it 
        to her. 

        George: Big screen TV?

        Frank: Do you think you can handle it?


        [At the Drakette's]

        (knock on door, the Drakette opens)

        Alison: Yes?

        George: Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the 
        TV.

        Alison: Oh great, it's right over there.

        Kramer: Ooh, it's a big one!


        {All four inside a delivery van outside the mall)

        George: Who's got the receipt?

        Elaine: I do. 

        George: Will they give us cash?

        Jerry: That's their policy. 

        George: I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...

        Kramer: Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?

        George: What if there is a fire?

        Kramer: What are the chances of that?

A very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find you way back after you left.You know there are two types of female orgasm: the real and the fake. And I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'.

What's that?JERRY: All right, let me ask you this: when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?GEORGE: Yeah.JERRY: You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?GEORGE: CleaningJERRY: You do the tub?GEORGE: Yeah.JERRY: On your knees, Ajax, scrubbing, the whole deal?GEORGE: Yeah.JERRY: Okay, I think you're in love!GEORGE: Tub is love?JERRY: Tub is love. So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.GEORGE: Yep. There's one little problem. JERRY: Sexual?GEORGE: Yeeeaaah. Well..... I've never really feld confident in..... one particular aspect. JERRY: Below the equator?GEORGE: Yeah. JERRY: Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort. GEORGE: I don't know. Last time I got the tap. JERRY: You got the tap?GEORGE: You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.JERRY: The tap is tough.GEORGE: It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.JERRY: Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.GEORGE: No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that. JERRY: It's a very complicated area.GEORGE: You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.JERRY: It's a haaazy mystery.GEORGE: Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking. (Elaine joins them)ELAINE: Who's faking?GEORGE: Nothing.ELAINE: Faking what?GEORGE: Nobody's faking.ELAINE: Ah! Orgasm?GEORGE: She's not faking!ELAINE: How do you know?GEORGE: I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?ELAINE: Of course.JERRY: Really?GEORGE: You faked?ELAINE: On occasion.JERRY: And the guy never knows?ELAINE: No.JERRY: How can he not know that?ELAINE: Because I was gooood.JERRY: I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.(Jerry and George laugh)ELAINE: You didn't know.JERRY: What?ELAINE: You didn't know.JERRY: Are you saying...(George calls a waitress)GEORGE: I think I'll have a piece of cake.JERRY: With me? ELAINE: Well...JERRY: You faked with me? ELAINE: Yeah.JERRY: You faked with me?ELAINE: Yeah.JERRY: No.ELAINE: Yeah.JERRY: You faked it?ELAINE: I faked it.JERRY: That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?ELAINE: Not bad huh?JERRY: What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?ELAINE: Fake, fake, fake, fake.JERRY: I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?ELAINE: Uuuhm, all the time.JERRY: All the time?!GEORGE: We got a chocolate malt in here!JERRY: But I'm so good.GEORGE: I'm sure you are.ELAINE: Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then. JERRY: She faked.(George smiles sarcastically)JERRY: Maybe they've all been faking.ELAINE: I'm sure they're not.GEORGE: Maybe Karin is faking.[location: Jerry's apartment](Kramer is lighting his cigar on the stove)KRAMER: She was probably joking.JERRY: No no, it was no joke.KRAMER: She didn't have any?JERRY: No. None.KRAMER: She faked 'em all.JERRY: Faked 'em all.KRAMER: Well so she faked 'em, so what?JERRY: The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury. KRAMER: You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.JERRY: How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it. KRAMER: Yeah I could have helped you out.JERRY: What could you have done?KRAMER: I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons body.JERRY: I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.KRAMER: Aaaaah.JERRY: Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her. (The phone rings)KRAMER: Giddy-up.(Jerry picks it up)JERRY: Hello... Oh hello Elaine.ELAINE: So we're having dinner tonight?JERRY: I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.ELAINE: Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you? JERRY: What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.ELAINE: Nooo, the other thing.JERRY: Oooh that. Well...ELAINE: Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it. JERRY: Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?ELAINE: Okay. JERRY: All right.ELAINE: All right, see you later.JERRY: Bye.ELAINE: Bye.[location: Elaine's office](Rene walks passed the office)ELAINE: Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something: have you ever... you know... faked it?RENE: Yeah, sometimes. ELAINE: Really, like when?RENE: Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats.ELAINE: Yeah, well...RENE: Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep.[location: Jerry's apartment]JERRY: I really don't feel like seeing her.KRAMER: You know, I faked it.JERRY: What?!KRAMER: Yeah.JERRY: You faked it? Why would you do that?KRAMER: Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.JERRY: Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer spits out his peach)JERRY: Bad peach?KRAMER: It's terrible! JERRY: Did you get that at Joe's?KRAMER: Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.JERRY: That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.KRAMER: You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna return this.JERRY: You're returning used fruit?KRAMER: Jerry this peach is sub par.[location: Joe's]JOE: So what do you want me to do?KRAMER: I want restitution.JOE: Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?KRAMER: Because it's no good.JOE: When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.KRAMER: It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.JOE: I stand behind my fruit.KRAMER: So...JOE: Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.KRAMER: You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.JOE: Well let me put a solution for you: do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business.KRAMER: Oh now you don't want my business.JOE: No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!KRAMER: But what am I gonna do for fruit?[location: restaurant](Karin starts moaning and lights a cigarette after finishing dinner)GEORGE: You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. You have a very contented air over there. You look very contented, very satisfied. Are you satisfied?KARIN: I'm very satisfied.GEORGE: I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?KARIN: I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma. GEORGE: Hey listen... instead of the movie... maybe we'll go back and... you know...KARIN: Maybe.GEORGE: So... you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... generally okay with everything in there?KARIN: Generally.GEORGE: Do you feel the way you feel after the Risotto?KARIN: No, I feel full after the Risotto.GEORGE: Yeah... full.[location: (another) restaurant](Elaine starts moaning after finishing dinner)JERRY: Satisfied?ELAINE: Hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?JERRY: Meryl Streep?ELAINE: You don't like her?JERRY: Ah, she's okay.ELAINE: I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.JERRY: Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?ELAINE: I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill. JERRY: Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this? ELAINE: What's the matter?JERRY: Nothing.ELAINE: You're not still thinking about that are you?JERRY: Nooo.ELAINE: Oh good.JERRY: Give me another shot!ELAINE: What?JERRY: Another shot, I want another shot.ELAINE: You mean...?JERRY: Yes! ELAINE: Oooh no, I don't think so.JERRY: Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!ELAINE: Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.JERRY: Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .ELAINE: Jerry no, that's important to me.JERRY: We won't ruin the friendship. ELAINE: Yes we will!JERRY: Elaine...ELAINE: No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it. JERRY: A half hour, give me a half our.ELAINE: No!JERRY: Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!ELAINE: No!JERRY: You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you? ELAINE: What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.JERRY: That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.ELAINE: That is so ridiculous.JERRY: Come on, Elaine!ELAINE: No.JERRY: Elaine?!ELAINE: No![location: Karin's bedroom](George indicates that the sex went wrong)GEORGE: It's Jerry's fault.KARIN: Jerry?GEORGE: Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.KARIN: Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right. GEORGE: So you feel okay?KARIN: Well, it's not like after the Risotto.[location: Jerry's car]JERRY: Well good night.ELAINE: I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.JERRY: Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.ELAINE: Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).JERRY: Oh what, you're upset?ELAINE: Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?JERRY: No I can't, maybe you're faking.ELAINE: I'm really, really sorry I told you that. JERRY: I'm sorry too.ELAINE: Well stop being such a baby.JERRY: You're a baby!ELAINE: You're a baby![location: Jerry's apartment]GEORGE: It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.'JERRY: They're mysterious little fellows aren't they? GEORGE: I hate 'em!JERRY: You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens. GEORGE: It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.(Kramer enters the apartment)KRAMER: Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?JERRY: Why can't you get it?KRAMER: Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.JERRY: What happened?KRAMER: Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and... well Joe doesn't want my business.GEORGE: Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?JERRY: No. (And to Kramer:) I told you not to say anything. KRAMER: Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?JERRY: Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.KRAMER: The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit! JERRY: Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now? GEORGE: Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?(George leaves the apartment)(The phone rings, Jerry picks it up)JERRY: Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I just wanted to ask you a question: when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Okay, bye.(Jerry hangs up the phone)JERRY: Patty Lawrence had 'em!KRAMER: Okay, I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?JERRY: Yeah.(Jerry makes another call)JERRY: Hello Elaine? Patty Lorens had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?[location: outside Joe's]JERRY: Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?KRAMER: All right now here's the list.JERRY: All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?KRAMER: I like mangos.JERRY: Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.KRAMER: Well they gotta be soft.JERRY: How soft?KRAMER: Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.JERRY: I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?KRAMER: Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.JERRY: Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?KRAMER: Oh! And get some plantains.JERRY: Plantains? KRAMER: Yeah.JERRY: What the hell is a plantain.KRAMER: It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.JERRY: You're not getting any plantains.(Jerry enters Joe's)JERRY: Hey Joe.JOE: How is it going?JERRY: Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. I don't know let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... ooo, just right... and three plantains ought to do it.JOE: All right, all right, just hold it right there.JERRY: What?JOE: This fruit isn't for you. JERRY: What, what are you talking about?JOE: You think I don't know? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!JERRY: I can't buy mangos and plantains?JOE: All right, get out!JERRY: You're making a big mistake, Joe!JOE: I'll tell you something else: I don't what your business anymore either. JERRY: You're saying you're banning me from the store?JOE: That's exactly what I'm saying.JERRY: I'm banned?!JOE: You're banned.[location: Jerry's apartment]GEORGE: All right, where do you want it?JERRY: Put it over there. KRAMER: Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, you did good George.(Kramer leaves the apartment)GEORGE: All right I gotta get going.JERRY: What are you doing?GEORGE: I got a date with Karin. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there. JERRY: You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.GEORGE: I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.(Kramer enters the apartment)KRAMER: This mango is delicious!GEORGE: That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty. JERRY: Sorry, I don't have any cash. KRAMER: I only got hundreds.GEORGE: All right I knew it.KRAMER: Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.GEORGE: I don't want any mango.KRAMER: Come on, take some. It's good.(George tries a piece)GEORGE: Very good. Juicy. Ripe. This Joe's got some terrific fruit. (George looks a little weird)JERRY: What?GEORGE: I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!KRAMER: I told you.(George stands still)JERRY: What is it?GEORGE: I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.(Elaine enters the apartment)ELAINE: Hi George.GEORGE: I'm back, baby, I'm back!(George leaves the apartment)KRAMER: Want some mango?ELAINE: No, thanks.(Kramer leaves the apartment)JERRY: Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. What brings you here?ELAINE: Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house. JERRY: Oh and I've got some things of yours here.ELAINE: I know.JERRY: Well I'll get them.ELAINE: I'm waiting.JERRY: All right. You got my fins?ELAINE: Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?JERRY: I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?ELAINE: They're next to the fins. You got my cards?JERRY: They're next to the poker chips.(They switch bags)ELAINE: All right and that just about... does it.JERRY: I guess.ELAINE: Okay, well... see you around.JERRY: Yeah, see you.(Elaine opens the door and then closes it again)ELAINE: All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.JERRY: What?ELAINE: Come on!JERRY: Are you serious?ELAINE: Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.JERRY: Sex... to save the friendship. Well, if we have to...[location: Karin's bedroom]KARIN: Oh George, oooh.GEORGE: Please, it's not necessary.KARIN: What do you mean it's not necessary?GEORGE: The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?KARIN: What are you talking about?GEORGE: What am I talking about? Come on. You don't think I bought all that?KARIN: What, what?GEORGE: You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. You really had me going there for a minute.KARIN: You think I was faking?GEORGE: Come on: 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.KARIN: I'd like you to leave.GEORGE: What?KARIN: I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.GEORGE: But why?KARIN: Because I said so.GEORGE: I can't find my glasses.KARIN: Well hurry up.GEORGE: I need to look for my glasses.KARIN: Get out! Get out!! Get out!!![location: Jerry's bedroom](Elaine is reading a magazine and Jerry is making desperate noises)JERRY: It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. He got to me.

              George's stuff back into his parent's house)GEORGE: I can't believe this!JERRY: Oh, it won't be for that long.GEORGE: How can I do this?! How can I move back in with those people? 
              Please, tell me! They're insane! You know that.JERRY: Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.GEORGE: How can you compare you parents to my parents?!JERRY: My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!GEORGE: My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!JERRY: My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.GEORGE: (Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never 
              laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never 
              went 'Ha!'JERRY: A smirk?GEORGE: Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!JERRY: I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.GEORGE: No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having 
              sex. It just completely changes the relationship.(Kramer stumbles in)KRAMER: Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't 
              understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?GEORGE: I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left 
              in the bank.KRAMER: Well, move in here.JERRY: (Stopping the notion) What's that?KRAMER: Why doesn't he just move in here?GEORGE: (Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He 
              doesn't even let you use the toilet!KRAMER: You can move in with me, if you want.GEORGE: (Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.(Scene ends)[Setting: The Costanza's house](Jerry, George, and Kramer enter carrying George's luggage. Kramer 
              clumsily bangs the wall with one of the suitcases)ESTELLE: Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!KRAMER: Hello, Mrs. Costanza.ESTELLE: Hello, Kramer. Close the door.(They set down George's luggage)KRAMER: Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)ESTELLE: More stuff?!KRAMER: Yeah. (Exits)ESTELLE: (To George) How much is there?!GEORGE: (Annoyed) There's more.ESTELLE: So, how are ya, Jerry?JERRY: Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) 
              Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..ESTELLE: (Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.JERRY: No, no. It's really funny. There's these two guys-ESTELLE: (Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives 
              Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) 
              I made some bolognasandwiches.GEORGE: Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!ESTELLE: What are you talking about?! Have a sandwich.JERRY: No thanks.(Kramer enters with some more suitcases)ESTELLE: Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?KRAMER: Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)ESTELLE: I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts 
              the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young 
              men.JERRY: I really don't eat it.ESTELLE: What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you 
              take them home? Give them to someone in your building?JERRY: I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna 
              sandwiches in the building..KRAMER: (Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?GEORGE: (Muttering) No, that's it.(A horn honks from outside the house)KRAMER: Oh, I gotta go move the car. (Leaves)JERRY: Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)GEORGE: (Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're 
              going?JERRY: Yeah.GEORGE: Wha - what are you doing later?JERRY: Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and 
              his new girlfriend.GEORGE: Really?JERRY: Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. 
              You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse 
              me?', 'what wasthat?'GEORGE: Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?ESTELLE: No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.GEORGE: (Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.JERRY: Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)(George watches his mother sitting contentedly on the couch. She's 
              staring off into space)GEORGE: Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)(Scene ends)[Setting: A Restaurant](Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and Leslie are all laughing)ELAINE: Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you 
              make your own pie! (Laughs)JERRY: Right.ELIANE: You remember that?KRAMER: Yeah, well, that was a good one.JERRY: Well..(Kramer's girlfriend starts to mumble out some words, but Kramer's 
              the only one who seems to hear her. Jerry and Elaine both bend forward, 
              trying to hear whatshe's saying)ELAINE: What's that?JERRY: Excuse me?(She 'talks' some more. Jerry and Elaine still can't hear her. 
              They give up - leaning back in their seats)JERRY: Yeah.. yeah.ELAINE: Yep. Yeah..KRAMER: You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing 
              business? She's a designer.ELAINE: (Interested) Oh?KRAMER: In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to 
              be the big new look in mens fashions.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie 
              mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah,it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.ELAINE: Oh, a puffy shirt.JERRY: Puffy.KRAMER: Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You 
              know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..(Leslie starts 'talking', Kramer laughs. Jerry and Elaine have 
              no clue what she's saying. They lean closer)KRAMER: (Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right 
              back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. 
              A moment passes)ELAINE: Uh, oh! (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's 
              going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.JERRY: Yeah, that's right!ELAINE: Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a benefit for Goodwill, you 
              know, they, uh, they clothe the poor, and the homeless..JERRY: (Points at Elaine) And the indigent.ELAINE: And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. 
              I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.(Leslie starts talking. Of course, Jerry and Elaine can't hear 
              her voice)JERRY: Sure.ELAINE: Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.(Leslie talks some more)JERRY: Uh-huh.ELAINE: Yep.JERRY: Yep..ELAINE: Mmm(Scene ends)[Setting: A Restaurant]ESTELLE: Maybe you should take a civil service test.GEORGE: (Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service 
              test.FRANK: Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You 
              ever seen a silver dollar?GEORGE: Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.ELAINE: Why don't you want to take a civil service test?GEORGE: To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want 
              me to do?FRANK: Would you believe when I was 18, I had a silver dollar collection?ESTELLE: I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay 
              check every week..GEORGE: I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?FRANK: (Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself 
              to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.ESTELLE: So what are you gonna do?!GEORGE: I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent 
              - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!FRANK: I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.GEORGE: (Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..FRANK: I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the 
              waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. 
              he doesn't want to come over.GEORGE: (Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need 
              some air..ESTELLE: George, where are you going?!GEORGE: (Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.(Scene cuts to the front of the restaurant. George accidentally 
              runs into a woman - causing her to drop her purse. Items spill out 
              onto the floor)GEORGE: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts 
              picking up her things)WOMAN: Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!GEORGE: (Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..WOMAN: No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her 
              things up)GEORGE: It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother 
              wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, 
              I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..(George hands the last of the items to her, she takes them from 
              him, then starts to admire his hand)WOMAN: Hmm..GEORGE: What?WOMAN: (Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.GEORGE: What about them?WOMAN: They're quite exquisite!GEORGE: They are?WOMAN: (Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand 
              modeling?GEORGE: Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')WOMAN: (Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) 
              Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call?

              hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.GEORGE: What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's 
              hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over 
              there - where do you get offcomparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. 
              (Points to his own hand)JERRY: Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your 
              whole life.GEORGE: This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in 
              the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take 
              it any more. I got up, and (Makes anoise) I bop into this woman..(Enter Kramer)KRAMER: Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's 
              coat hooks)JERRY: Hey.KRAMER: Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a 
              hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)GEORGE: What are you, crazy?!

Let me look at them..GEORGE: (Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. 
              (Holds them out. Kramer studies them)KRAMER: Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed 
              this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) 
              masculine.GEORGE: (Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts 
              them on) I gotta get going.JERRY: Oven mitts?GEORGE: (Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) 
              Would you mind getting the door?KRAMER: Yeah..JERRY: Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)GEORGE: Thank you very much. (Walks out)(Jerry shuts the door, then starts going through his mail)KRAMER: You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie.

              Since I said what?KRAMER: Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit 
              cover)JERRY: What are you talking about?KRAMER: When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt

I couldn't understand a word she was saying! 
              I was just nodding!KRAMER: There you go.JERRY: Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous 
              shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!KRAMER: Yes, yes! You said it!JERRY: But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't 
              hear her!KRAMER: (Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry

              you.JERRY: I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at 
              it! It looks ridiculous!KRAMER: Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking

              primping his fingernails)ESTELLE: I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful

              his hands?FRANK: (Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention 
              his hands to?ESTELLE: (Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!FRANK: You never mentioned them to me!GEORGE: (Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory 
              board.(Estelle hands an Emory board to George. He takes it, then goes 
              back to his manicure)ESTELLE: I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and 
              milky white..FRANK: No! You never said milky white!ESTELLE: (Getting angry) I said milky white!(A moment passes as George fights to keep his temper down around 
              his parents)GEORGE: (To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee 
              table and hands them to George) Don't hand them to me with the point 
              facing out!

              would you like some Jell-O?FRANK: (To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the 
              bananas in there?!ESTELLE: (Yelling) George likes the bananas!FRANK: (Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the 
              side!(George stands up with the manicure tray. He's obviously had enough)GEORGE: Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. 
              Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important 
              photo session in themorning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - 
              keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.ESTELLE: (Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?GEORGE: (Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)(Scene ends)[Setting: A Today Show dressing room](Jerry's in a back room, getting dressed while Kramer's thumbing

              shirt) Ayye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed 
              it. It's perfect. (Walks aroundJerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!JERRY: (Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I can't wear 
              this!KRAMER: (Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you 
              own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing 
              the (imitates a pirate) piratelook. Aye!(A knock at the door, Kramer answers it - it's Elaine)KRAMER: Yeah.ELAINE: Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said 
              he might help out at the benefit!KRAMER: Great.(Elaine stops in her tracks when she sees Jerry in the shirt. Then, 
              bursts out laughing hysterically)ELAINE: (Between laughs) What is that?!KRAMER: It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is 
              it cool or what?ELAINE: (To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?JERRY: (Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing 
              is now?'? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker 
              asked me to, that's why!And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!ELAINE: When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?JERRY: When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.ELAINE: I didn't hear anything.JERRY: (Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when 
              this woman speaks!ELAINE: (Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear 
              that on the show.KRAMER: (To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you 
              want to stop?ELAINE: (Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) 
              Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You 
              can't come outdressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count 
              of Monte Cristo!JERRY: (Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has 
              orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing 
              them as we speak!ELAINE: (Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate 
              person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. 
              swing in on achandelier!(A knock at the door, Jerry answers)STAGEHAND: (Looking down at a clipboard, enters) Okay, let's go. 
              (Looks up, points at Jerry's puffy shirt) Is that what you're wearing?(Scene ends)[Setting: A photographer's studio](George is holding out his hands while a man and woman marvel at 
              them. A photographer is fooling around with a camera towards the 
              right wall)MAN: I've never seen hands like these before..WOMAN: They're so soft and milky white.PHOTOGRAPHER: You know who's hands they remind me of? (Pauses for 
              effect) Ray McKigney.(The woman nods as the man looks off into space)MAN: Ugh.. Ray.PHOTOGRAPHER: He was it.GEORGE: Who was he?PHOTOGRAPHER: The most exquisite hands you've ever seen.. Oh, he 
              had it all.GEORGE: (Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at 
              them) What happened to him?(Obviously a touchy subject, the woman coyly walks over to the 
              photographer, and they both occupy themselves. The man is left to 
              tell George the answer to hisquestion)MAN: (Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had 
              any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his 
              own hand.. and that became hisone true love..(Long pause)GEORGE: You mean, uh..?MAN: Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.GEORGE: (Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But 
              how.. uh..?MAN: (Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. 
              overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, 
              and he was left with nothingbut a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled 
              the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. 
              nothing helped. Towards theend, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, 
              (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts 
              to feed him. I hadn'tseen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's.. until today. You 
              are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I.. only hope 
              you have a little moreself-control.GEORGE: (Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. 
              (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.(The man nods, unsure of what to say or do)PHOTOGRAPHER: Ok, let's get to work.(Scene ends)[Setting: The Today Show](Jerry's in the guest chair, and Bryant Gumbel's in the interviewer's

              very unusual shirt you have on.JERRY: (Looking down at the shirt) Oh, thank you.(Backstage, Kramer's standing with his girlfriend. She's brimming 
              with pride)BRYANT: You're all kinda, (Waves his hands around) all kinda "puffed 
              up". (Chuckles)JERRY: Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.

JERRY: Why?AMY: I knew there had to be another side to you.JERRY: No, no, there's no side!AMY: There is a side, an ugly side.JERRY: No, no, no ugly side.AMY: Look, I think I'm gonna go.JERRY: Why?AMY: It's really hot in here.JERRY: Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?AMY: Yeah. When are you getting an air conditioner?JERRY: It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat 
                locker in here.[location: Jerry's apartment]JERRY: I was an idiot for listening to you!GEORGE: Hey, I saw what I saw.JERRY: Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. 
                Now she sees a side. GEORGE: What side?JERRY: A bad side, an ugly side. GEORGE: Ooh, so what?JERRY: So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. 
                Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.GEORGE: Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?JERRY: Ah, he'd just deny it.GEORGE: There must be some way to find out.JERRY: Amy said nothing happened.GEORGE: What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!JERRY: Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!GEORGE: I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? I was spotting 
                those raccoons. JERRY: They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.GEORGE: Hey look, a dime. (George walks over to the other end of the room and picks up a dime)GEORGE: Mercury head. You mind?JERRY: (Stunned:) No, keep it.(Elaine enters the apartment)JERRY: Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.ELAINE: There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't 
                come in until he left. JERRY: A little white dog? ELAINE: Yeah.JERRY: Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?ELAINE: I'm afraid of dogs now.JERRY: He's like a squirrel.ELAINE: Well he frightened me.GEORGE: Did you get the shot?ELAINE: No. He said I didn't need a shot.GEORGE: You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?ELAINE: What, you think I should have?(George indicates 'yes')JERRY: You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne 
                if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.ELAINE: All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.(Kramer enters the apartment)KRAMER: The AC is on his way.GEORGE: Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount. KRAMER: What?GEORGE: That's right, no discount!KRAMER: Well did you mention my name?GEORGE: Yes, I mentioned your name.KRAMER: And?GEORGE: Bubkis!KRAMER: Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off 
                sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.GEORGE: All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.JERRY: Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!KRAMER: Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!(George takes a bite out of an union)ELAINE: You know, George, that's an union.GEORGE: Yes it is.(And he takes another bite)ELAINE: He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?GEORGE: I saw them making out, you can believe it.JERRY: I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting 
                dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.KRAMER: Look, all you gotta to is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's 
                it. JERRY: Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment 
                tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. 
                All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's 
                Howdy Doody time.KRAMER: Right this way, mister Doody!GEORGE: You'll see I'm right.[location: J & T Optical]KRAMER: Hey, Dwayny.DWAYNE: Oh hello Kramer.KRAMER: What is going on here?DWAYNE: What are you talking about?KRAMER: I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.ELAINE: Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...GEORGE: Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.DWAYNE: Who said anything about a discount.KRAMER: Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.DWAYNE: For what?(Kramer pulls out a candy bar)KRAMER: Remember this?DWAYNE: What are you doing?KRAMER: Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing 
                it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?DWAYNE: Put that away!KRAMER: Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all hopped 
                up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have 
                any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuff 
                a cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!DWAYNE: All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put 
                that thing away! This squares us.ELAINE: Can I just have the name...DWAYNE: Out!KRAMER: We'll see you Dwayne.[location: Jerry's apartment](George shows Jerry his glasses)JERRY: I don't know what to tell you, Elton.ELAINE: (While reading a book:) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen 
                to these symptoms for rabies: anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!JERRY: (To George:) Who picked these out?GEORGE: I did!JERRY: They're ladies' glasses! All you need is that little chain around your 
                neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.GEORGE: Well Elaine was supposed to help me.(Elaine runs over to George and starts screaming)ELAINE: Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding 
                to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!JERRY: Hey, hey.ELAINE: I'm sorry... sorry.(Kramer enters the apartment with the air conditioner in his arms)KRAMER: Commando 8 has arrived!JERRY: Take it to the window.KRAMER: 12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power.(Kramer places the air conditioner in the window)KRAMER: Installed!GEORGE: That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?KRAMER: No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry:) 
                I'll seal that up later, right?JERRY: Just in time for Amy.GEORGE: Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plead?ELAINE: I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!KRAMER: Of what?JERRY: Rabies.KRAMER: Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!(Elaine runs over to Kramer and starts screaming again)ELAINE: I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, 
                you stupid hipster dufus!JERRY: Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?ELAINE: I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.KRAMER: No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips)KRAMER: May I have one of those, madam?GEORGE: Madame? What are you calling me madam for?KRAMER: They're ladies' glasses.(Kramer takes George's glasses and shows him the inside)KRAMER: Now look here, see it's right here: Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.GEORGE: He sold me ladies' glasses!ELAINE: I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't 
                swallow. KRAMER: She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious.(Elaine drinks some water and drools)KRAMER: She's foaming at the mouth![location: hospital]ELAINE: Is this gonna hurt?DOCTER: Yes, very much.(Elaine gets the shot)[location: Jerry's apartment]ELAINE: What if Jeffrey's not home.

                He looks like a horse!JERRY: He does look like a horse. ELAINE: Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window:) 
                Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams:) 
                Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!DOG OWNER: Who are you calling stupid?JERRY: Hey, shall we spit on him?ELAINE: No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.(Kramer enters the apartment)KRAMER: (Singing:) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles)KRAMER: The air conditioner!(Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps)KRAMER: I think it got the dog![location: New York Health Club's locker room]GEORGE: Oh boy.BLIND MAN: Excuse me, I'm new here, would you mind walking me back to my locker?GEORGE: Oh uuh, sure, hang on. Hey, that's the guy.BLIND MAN: What guy?GEORGE: The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em!(George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him)GEORGE: Would you pick it up a little?BLIND MAN: Where the hell are we going?GEORGE: He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man:) Those are nice glasses.BLIND MAN: I don't like 'em, they pinch my nose.GEORGE: Is that really?[location: J & T Optical](George has taken the blind man with him)GEORGE: Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put 
                his lenses in my frames and mine in his?DWAYNE: (While eating a candy bar:) Yeah, we can do that.GEORGE: And I'd like a discount. DWAYNE: Why should I give you a discount.GEORGE: Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a refund. You gave me ladies' 
                frames! BLIND MAN: What's that about ladies' frames?(The man with the dog enters and the dog wears a collar)DOG OWNER: I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, 
                the one that was messing with my dog.GEORGE: Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.DOG OWNER: Well I would love to talk with her. She lives on 81st Street, right?GEORGE: No, that's Jerry.DOG OWNER: Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would 
                you?GEORGE: Yeah, 5A!DOG OWNER: Thanks a lot![location: in front of Jeffrey's apartment]AMY: So what are we doing here?JERRY: Oh, you'll find out.AMY: I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously.JERRY: Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.(Jerry knocks on the door)JERRY: A lot of women find that attractive.AMY: I find it annoying.JERRY: Really?(Uncle Leo opens the door)UNCLE LEO: Helloooo!JERRY: Uncle Leo!UNCLE LEO: Come on in.JERRY: This is Amy.UNCLE LEO: Hello Amy.JERRY: Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?UNCLE LEO: Jeffrey went out tonight.JERRY: Ooh!

            Jerry, George and Elaine at Monk's Caf Jerry: So, does he like you? Elaine: What do you think? Jerry: You like him? Elaine: Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a 
              lot. George: What's wrong with him? Elaine: Nothing, and I've looked. George: Well, I'm sure you'll find something. Jerry: So, how did you meet him? Elaine: In the office. Jerry: So, he's a writer. Elaine: Yeah. Jerry: Yeah, big surprise. Elaine: So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking 
              pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps. George: What are those? Elaine: Ask your mother, you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, 
              so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through 
              his thumb and his forefingerlike this. Jerry: So, what did you do? Elaine: I said: "So, what do you think?". And he said, 
              "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it. 
            George: Wow, just felt your material? Elaine: Yeah...Jake Jarmel. George: Sounds like a cool guy. Jerry: Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on. George: Jerry, where did you get that sweater? Jerry: What do you think? I found it at the back of my closet. 
            George: I think that's what the back of closets are for. *Elaine looks out the window* Elaine: Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. Jerry: Hey... Elaine: Hi. George: Who's that? Jerry: That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant. George: I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money. 
            Elaine: Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. 
              He just does my taxes. *Barry comes in* Jerry: Hey Barry, how you doing? This is my friend George. Barry: Hi George. Elaine: Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood? Barry: Nothing really. *sniffs* You, eh, you eat here? Jerry: Yeah, so how's my money? Barry: Still green. *sniffs* Jerry: What, you got a cold? Barry: No, no. Elaine: Wow, look at that ring. Barry: Oh, you like that? *sniffs* Say, where's the bathroom? Jerry: Bathroom, bathroom is right over there. *Barry goes to bathroom* Jerry: Did you see that? Elaine: See what? George: Yes, I saw that. Jerry: What was all that sniffing? Elaine: I don't know. Jerry: You don't think...? Elaine: Oh, no! Come on Jerry. George: He was definitely sniffing. Jerry: I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. 
              Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy can write 
              checks to himself right out of my account. Elaine: I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs. 
            Jerry: Then, what was all that sniffing? Elaine: Maybe it's the cold weather. Jerry: Today is not cold. George: All right, I've got to get going. My parents are expecting 
              me. Elaine: Don't forget to wash your hands before supper. ------------------------------------------------------- *Costanza's. George, Estelle and Frank are eating dinner. George 
              is pounding a ketchup bottle.* Frank: Why do you need all that ketchup for? George: This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could 
              have as much as I want. Frank: So, I talked to Phil Casacof today. Estelle: Phil Casacof? Frank: Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they 
              are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next 
              Friday with his boss. George: Next Friday, what time? Frank: 2 o'clock. George: That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers. 
            Frank: You can look for sneakers the next day! Estelle: He doesn't know anything about bras. George: I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know? Frank: Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss 
              it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? Where 
              is you bra? Give him a bra to look. Estelle: I am not giving him a bra. Frank: Why not? Estelle: Because I don't need him looking at my bra. Frank: Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what 
              he's talking about!?! George: Do we have to...? Frank: You don't even know what they're made from. George: They are made from lycra-spandex. Frank: Get out of here! Lycra-spandex? Estelle: I think they are made from lycra-spandex. Frank: Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet? Estelle: I'm not betting! Frank: Take a look. Estelle: All right, I'll get a bra. Frank: I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?! George: She doesn't want to get a bra. Frank: I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, 
              but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it. George: All right, it wouldn't kill me. Frank: How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? 
              You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you 
              know about the cup sizes and all? They have different cups. George: I-I know about the cups. Frank: You got the A, B, C the D. That's the biggest. George: I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on 
              knowing that the D is the biggest. Estelle: Here, here's the bra. Frank: Let me see it. Estelle: 100% lycra-spandex. Frank: Let me see it. Estelle: I told you. Here, think you know everything? Frank: Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the 
              cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's 
              about it. George: I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. Estelle: You got ketchup on it! *George takes his plate and the ketchup and leaves.* -------------------------------------------------------- *5A. Jerry and Kramer.* Kramer: Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing? Jerry: Sniffing, with his nose. Kramer: Jerry, he probably had a cold. Jerry: No, I asked him. Kramer: So, what are you saying? Jerry: I don't know, you know, what if...? Kramer: Drugs? You think he's on drugs? Jerry: I don't know. All I know he was sniffing. Kramer: Jerry, listen, we went in on a CD together. Jerry: I know. Kramer: And Newman gave you money too. I didn't even meet this 
              guy. We trusted you. Jerry: Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just 
              means he was sniffing. Kramer: Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? 
              Did he use the word 'man'? Jerry: No, he didn't use 'man'. Kramer: I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin' ? Jerry: No, but in one point he did use the bathroom. Kramer: Whoh! Jerry: Do you think that's a bad sign? Kramer: Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! 
              All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money 
              back, right? Jerry: I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it? 
            Kramer: Yeah. ----------------------------------------------------- *Elaine's apartment. Jake is there and Elaine comes in.* Elaine: Hello.... hello, oh... Jake: Well, you notice anything? Elaine: You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making 
              dinner. Oh, you are a perfect, you are a perfect man. *Jake feels Elaine's coat material.* Jake: Ooh... Elaine: Did anyone call? Jake: I got a few messages, I wrote them down. Elaine: Where are they? Jake: Lets see, they are...here they are. Elaine: Thank you. Heh, I'll call you back.Ooh, Myra had the baby! 
              Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called? Jake: She did. Elaine: She did? Oh, that's so great! Jake: Where do you keep the corkscrew? Elaine: In the drawer on the right. Hmm... Jake: What? Elaine: Oh it's nothing. Jake: What is it? Elaine: It's nothing. Jake: Tell me. Elaine: Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation 
              point? Jake: What are you talking about? Elaine: See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", 
              but you didn't use an exclamation point. Jake: So? Elaine: So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it 
              curious. Jake: What's so curious about it? Elaine: Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and 
              I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point. 
            Jake: Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly 
              as you do. Elaine: You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an 
              exclamation point. Jake: Hey, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was 
              required to capture the mood of each caller. Elaine: I just thought you would be a little more excited about 
              a friend of mine having a baby. Jake: Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation 
              points. Elaine: Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like 
              the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points 
              at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one! 
            Jake: Well, you can put one on this one: I'm leaving! --------------------------------------------------- 5A. Jerry and Elaine Jerry: You're out of your mind you know that. Elaine: What? Jerry: It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under 
              it. Elaine: Well, I felt a call for one. Jerry: A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. 
              I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation. 
            Elaine: I found it very troubling that he didn't use one. Jerry: George was right. Didn't take you long. *Kramer enters* Kramer: Anything new on that guy on drugs? Elaine: He's not on drugs. Kramer: Then why the sniffing? Who walks around *sniff, sniff* 
              sniffing? Elaine: All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing 
              right now. Jerry: Good idea. Voice on the phone: Prophet and Goldstein. Jerry: Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please. voice: I'm sorry he's out of town. Jerry: Out of town? voice: Yes, he went to South America. Jerry: South America? Kramer: South America? Jerry: I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America! Kramer: Yyyeeaaah!! Elaine: So what? Jerry: Who goes to South America? Elaine: People go to South America. Jerry: Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large 
              intestine. Elaine: So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an

            Newman: South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us 
              mixed up with? Elaine: Ok, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. 
              This is all speculation and hearsay. Kramer: Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. 
              You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry. Elaine: What are you gonna do? You gonna put on a phony beard and 
              dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean 
              come on... Jerry: Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and 
              find out... Newman: If we put our three heads together we should come up with 
              something. --------------------------------------------------------*Jerry, Kramer and Newman in the Saab* Kramer: What's today? Newman: It's Thursday. Kramer: Really? Feels like Tuesday. Newman: Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel,

              Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now. Newman: Hey, you know this is kind of fun. Kramer: Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives... Jerry: Yeah maybe you should. Kramer: Maybe I will. Newman: Yeah, me too. Jerry: All right, what are you gonna say to him? Kramer: Just gonna find out if he's interested. Newman: Hey, hey maybe I should go with him? Jerry: No, you stay in the car. Newman: Who made you the leader? Jerry: All right Newman, one more peep out of you and you're out 
              of the whole operation! There he is. He's going to that bar. Kramer: All right, I'm going in. Jerry: Be careful Kramer. Newman: I've should've gone in with him. Jerry: No, you stay here in the car. I may need you. Newman: What you need me in the car for?

            Barry: Yeah. Kramer: Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then 
              again, I've been known to do a lot of things. *Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head* Kramer: Cigarette? Barry: No, I never touch them. Kramer: I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good 
              all the time. *Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time* 
            *Barry sniffs* Kramer: Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh? 
            Barry: I don't think so. Kramer: Me neither. *Kramer puts the cigarette wrong way to his mouth* ---------------------------------------------------- *Back in the car with Jerry and Newman.* Jerry: You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic. 
            Newman: I use dental tape. Jerry: You should try this. Newman: I don't wanna. Jerry: Not even once? Newman: No. Jerry: You're an idiot. Newman: Why, because I use dental tape? Jerry: Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot. ---------------------------------------------------- *Back in the bar.* Kramer: South America? Barry: Yeah, yeah. Kramer: That's importuning(?) continent. Barry: They are expanding their economic base. Kramer: Tell me about it. Barry: Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. Kramer: I'm hip. Barry: Hip to the what? Kramer: To the whole scene. *sniff* Barry: What scene? Kramer: The bathroom scene. *sniff, sniff* Barry: Listen, don't take this personally, but when I'm coming 
              back I'm sitting over there. ---------------------------------------------------- *Back in the car. Newman takes a dental floss out of his mouth.* 
            Newman: No, no I don't like it. Jerry: What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like 
              it? Newman: I like the thick tape. *Newman puts dental floss on the dashboard. Jerry looks disgusted.* 
            --------------------------------------------------- *The bar. Kramer enters the bathroom, kicks the door open and takes 
              a photograph.* Barry: Heeyy!! What kind of a nut are you? -------------------------------------------------- *George's job interview.* Farkus: So, basically the job here is quite simple. Selling bras. 
            George: Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much 
              indeed, sir. Farkus: Have you ever sold a woman's line before? George: No, but I have very good repute with women, very good, 
              top form. And the first time I laid my I on brassieres I was enthralled. 
            Farkus: Hum. tell me about it. George: Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. 
              His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod. I picked 
              it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way 
              or what level, but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres. Farkus: That's incredible story. You have a remarkable passion 
              for brassieres. George: They are more than an underwear to me Mr.Farkus. Two cups 
              in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it? Farkus: Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, 
              that you'll have a very bright future here at ED Granmont. George: Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed. Farkus: See you monday 9 o'clock. George: If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8. Farkus: Excellent. George: So long, Mr. Farkus. *George leaves the office and goes to the elevator. A women there

              to start on monday. Ms. De Granmont: If he's here on monday, you're not. Take a pick. 
            Farkus to George: Get out! Farkus to Ms. De Granmont: I'm terribly sorry Ms. De Granmont... 
            -------------------------------------------------------- *Pendant publishing. Elaine is at Lippman's office.* Elaine: You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman? Lippman: I was just going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand 
              you worked with him very closely. Elaine: Yes, krhm, yes I did. Lippman: And, anyway I was just reading your final edit, um, there 
              seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points. Elaine: Well, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and 
              intensity. Lippman: Oh, "It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided 
              to put on my sweatshirt!" Elaine: Right, well... Lippman: You put exclamation point after sweatshirt? Elaine: That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't 
              like to be ch-ch-chilly... Lippman: I see, "I pulled the lever on the machine, but the 
              Clark bar didn't come out!" Exclamation point? Elaine: Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you 
              keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then *prrt* 
              nothing comes out... Lippman: Get rid of the exclamation points... Elaine: Ok, ok ok ... Lippman: I hate exclamation points... Elaine: ...ok I'll just.... --------------------------------------------------------- *5A. Jerry, Kramer, Newman writing a letter. Elaine reads on the 
              couch.* Jerry: 'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination 
              of our relationship effective immediately.' Kramer: Exclamation point. Elaine: You still have no proof. Kramer: Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me. Jerry: 'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later 
              than the 18th'. Kramer: Double exclamation point! Newman: Will that take care of ours too? Jerry: Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back. 
            Newman: Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway. 
            Jerry: Yeah, thanks. Newman: It'll be my pleasure. *Kramer puts the photograph to the envelope. Newman and Kramer

That'll be 14,30. Jerry: All right. Kramer: Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry? Jerry: Yeah. *Ralph sniffs and rubs his eyes.* Kramer: What's the matter? You've got a cold? Ralph: No Kramer, what is this? Kramer: It's a sweater. Ralph: What's it made out of? Kramer: I don't know, Jerry gave it to me. Jerry: Mohair, I think. Ralph: Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair. Jerry: You mean you just started sniffing? Ralph: Yeah, mohair does it to me every time. *Ralph leaves* Jerry: I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry 
              came in. Kramer: Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar. Elaine: The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! I told you he 
              wasn't a drug addict. Jerry: Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all 
              over it! Kramer: Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet. *Jerry leaves the door and comes back second later* Jerry: The what?? ---------------------------------------------------- *Newman is taking the letter to the mailbox. There's a woman at 
              same time at the letterbox.* Newman: After you. Woman: Thank you. *Newman feels the woman's coat material.* Woman: Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny! *Newman rushes away dropping the letter on the ground.* --------------------------------------------------- *Costanza's* Frank: What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your 
              fingers like this? George: So what, what is so bad about that? Estelle: Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be 
              gained feeling a person's material? It's insanity! Frank: What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you 
              have on. May I have this dance?"!! -------------------------------------------------- *At the caf. Kramer and Elaine.* Elaine: You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter. Jerry: Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer. 
            Elaine: What is this? Jerry: It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer. Elaine: He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why 
              is he filing a chapter eleven? Jerry: Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and 
              spent it on drugs! Elaine: What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater. Kramer: All right, What about the money? Jerry: What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship 
              with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the 
              money back. Which Iwould've done, if for certain imbecile had been able to get to 
              a mailbox and mail a letter!! *Newman enters and goes to the counter.* Newman: Pair of bear claws, please. *Jerry approaches Newman, but some women comes between and feels 
              Jerry's shirt.* Woman: Nice. Jerry: Think so? Woman: Yeah, what is it? Jerry: Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?

The damage,unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, renderingit virtually undriveable.Mrs. SWEEDLER(STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is a shame.GeorgeYes, a shame. That's just how I would describe it. Now, with alldue sensitivity and discretion, bearing in mind the scope of thesituation, I can't help but think the hospital bears someresponsibility to compensate the other, still living "victim",

To me I don't understand all the shushing. 
              Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that 
              we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't 
              see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the 
              players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy 
              scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two 
              points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll 
              be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, 
              shh."(Commercial)In the bleachers at the tennis court. Two players are hitting the 
              ball back and forth.Jerry: Are these seats unbelievable or what?George: Where's the sunblock?Jerry: Here.George: 25? You don't have anything higher?Jerry: What, are you on Mercury?George: I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.Jerry: You got a problem with paba?George: Yes, I have a problem with paba.Jerry: You don't even know what paba is.George: I know enough to stay away from it.George: So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?Jerry: I'll go if someone else drives. You going?George: Gwen really wants to go.Jerry: You're bringing a date to a party?George: No good?Jerry: A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're 
              with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and 
              talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) 
              Ho, ho, ho.George: Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk 
              to?Jerry: Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross 
              dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.George: Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. 
              Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.Jerry: That woman is absolutely stunning.George: The Croat? [the tennis player]Jerry: Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful 
              lineswoman I've ever seen.George: Yeah, she's a B.L.Jerry: B.L.?George: Beautiful lineswoman. I'm going to go to the concession 
              stand and get some real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry? (Jerry 
              is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?At Elaine's office.Coworker: You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out.Elaine: You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?Coworker: Take a car service. We have an account.Elaine: Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver 
              will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem 
              he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything 
              always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that 
              would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, 
              and the driver is way up there on the stage. Coworker: Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in 
              the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down.Elaine: I guess that could work.At the tennis court concession stand. George is eating a sundae.At Jerry's apartment. Kramer is watching TV.Announcer: And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Comming 
              up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a 
              look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop.Kramer: Hey, hey, it's George.George is on TV eating a sundae. His face is covered in ice cream 
              and fudge. He is taking a bite of ice cream and dripping it around 
              his mouth.Announcer: Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can 
              cover a lot of court. Hey buddy, they got a new invention. It's 
              called a napkin. We'll take a station break and continue with more...Elaine in the car service car.Driver: Dag Gavershole Plaza (sp?) huh? (Elaine ignores him) Pendant 
              Publishing, that's books right? (Elaine is annoyed and still ignoring 
              him) Miss?Elaine: Pardon me?Driver: Books, that's what you do?Elaine: Yeah.Driver: Yeah, I don't read much myself, (Elaine is annoyed) well 
              you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, 
              but not me. You know what I do? Elaine: You know I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back 
              here. So...Driver: (Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed) 
              when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey do you make a book of Jumbles?Elaine: I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.Driver: Going deaf?Elaine: What?Driver: Oh I'm sorry.Elaine: It can be very frustrating.Driver: Hey what about a hearing aid?Elaine: An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know 
              you gotta live your life.Driver: No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. (Elaine looks pleased)At the tennis court.Jerry: I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman 
              is absolutely mesmerizing.George: Boy you are really smitten.Jerry: I gotta talk to her. What do you think?George: Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those 
              guys.Jerry: I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that 
              just walk across the hot coals.George: They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the 
              other side.Jerry: I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.George: Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you 
              go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here 
              on this side. Take me with you.Jerry: I can't.George: What are you going to say?Jerry: I don't know, "Hi".George: You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? 
              You're not going to make it.Elaine in the car service car.Radio: Base to 92 come inDriver: Yes this is 92Radio: After this go back to city for a 6:00 pickupDriver: RighteoRadio: 794 Bleeker the party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.Elaine: Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love 
              him.Driver: So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?Elaine: Yeah. Yes it does...Driver: Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole 
              thing up. Elaine: No no, no no.Driver: Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation 
              with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. 
              But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is 
              truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted 
              by your behavior.At the tennis court. Jerry is standing behind the lineswoman.Jerry: Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores 
              him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. 
              Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've 
              got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too 
              good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and 
              notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?Laura: Bingo.At Jerry's apartment.Kramer: And you're saying she's deaf.Jerry: I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.Kramer: Can't hear a thing.Jerry: Can't hear a thing.Kramer: And you're going to go out with her.Jerry: Yeah, isn't that something?Elaine enters.Elaine: Hey.Jerry and Kramer: Hey.Kramer: Hey I know how to sign. Jerry: Really?Kramer: Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us 
              for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able 
              to do it in a while.Elaine: What is this about?Jerry: I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.Elaine: You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry 
              falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and 
              to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.Jerry: Wow good plan.Elaine: Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible, 
              but I'm not a terrible person.Jerry and Kramer: No.Elaine: No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get 
              out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to 
              injure them like other people. Jerry: That's nice.Elaine: Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever 
              stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because 
              I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.Jerry: That's nice for the freaks.Elaine: Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie 
              so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy 
              or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?Jerry: Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about 
              that friend of yours that works at the ticket area.Kramer: Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. 
              Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.Elaine: Oh, thanks Kramer.Kramer: You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you 
              see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. 
              I would love to be able to do that.Jerry: Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key 
              aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There 
              are no ball men.Elaine: Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.Kramer: Well there ought to be ball men.Jerry: All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man 
              go ahead, break the ball barrier.Elaine: Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw 
              George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.Kramer: Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating 
              a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing 
              that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real 
              nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream.)At Monk's.Gwen: I'm sorry George.George: I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? 
              Something must have happened.Gwen: It's not you, it's me.George: You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" 
              routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells 
              me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.Gwen: All right, George, it's you.George: You're *damn* right it's me.Gwen: I was just trying to...George: I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better 
              than me.Gwen: I'm sure you do it very well.George: Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find 
              out.George then looks confused like what he said just didn't sound 
              right.At Jerry's apartment.Jerry: But I thought things were going great.George: Yeah so did I.Jerry: Did she say why?George: No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" 
              routine.Jerry: But that's your routine.George: Yeah. Well aparently word's out.Kramer enters.Kramer: Hey, George, I saw you on TV yesterday.George: Really? At the tennis match?Kramer: Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.George: Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.Kramer: Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they 
              made a couple of cracks about you.George: Cracks? What were they saying?Kramer: That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking 
              about how funny you looked.George: Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.Kramer: Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.George: She must have seen me eating it on TV.Jerry: So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends 
              it? You really think she would be that superficial?George: Why not. I would be.The phone rings.Jerry: Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice 
              cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye. George: You're parents saw me on TV?Jerry: Yeah.George: This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?Kramer: It felt like 8 seconds.George: One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.Elaine enters.Elaine: I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape 
              it?George: Can we move on?Jerry: He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating 
              the ice cream on TV.Elaine: Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.George: Yes I do.Elaine: So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.George: Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.Kramer: Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.Jerry: Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral 
              place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite? Kramer: Excellent question.Jerry: I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the 
              breakee. He needs to get on with his life.Elaine: I beg to differ.Jerry: Really.Elaine: He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong 
              the spoils.Jerry: Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want 
              to fight that traffic on Friday night.Elaine: Well we can take the car service from my office.Jerry: Really?Elaine: Yeah, they don't know.Kramer: All right, I'll see you later.Jerry: Okay.George: "To the victor goes the spoils." What are you 
              going to do tonight?Jerry: Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.George: Oh. (he stands there)Jerry: Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what 
              are you doing?George: Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want 
              to tag along with you or anything.Jerry: Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?George: Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) 
              where would we be going?At a Chinese restaurant.George: So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no 
              napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that 
              concession stand cost me a relationship.Laura: They never have napkins there.Jerry: Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this considered 
              signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know 
              a sign, that's my first sign.Laura: Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up.George: They're breaking up? How do you know?Jerry: She reads lips.George: What are they saying now?Laura: "It's not you, it's me."George: (Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just 
              had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read 
              Gwen's lips for me.Jerry: (Puts his hand over his mouth) What?George: (Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his 
              mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen 
              is saying about me.Jerry: (Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, 
              George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.George: (Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's 
              a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.Jerry: (Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm 
              not sure about this.George: (Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth 
              with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case 
              closed.Jerry: (Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.Jerry: Uh Laura, George was wondering if...Laura: Sure. I'll do it.After the restaurant. Jerry at Laura's place.Jerry: So I really had a good time.Laura: Yeah, me too.Jerry: So you want to go to the party on Friday night?Laura: Yeah.Jerry: All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by 
              and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. 
              (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura 
              opens the door and gets out). What? What? (Commercial)At the tennis court.Man: Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've 
              only got two spots to fill. Good luck.Boy: Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight 
              years?Kramer: I may be old, but I'm spry.Boy: The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up 
              for it?Kramer: Oh I'll be up for it punk.Kramer fetches some balls, and he is doing some pretty fancy footwork.At Jerry's apartment.Jerry: See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying 
              "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.George: She confused "six" with "sex"?Jerry: Yeah.George: Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" 
              then how is she going to lip read from across the room?Jerry: Well "six" and "sex" are close.George: It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and 
              "eh".Jerry: Eh.George: It seems like a problem.Jerry: Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.Kramer enters.Kramer: Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.Jerry: You're kidding.Kramer: Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls 
              with such gusto.George: When is that car service comming?Jerry: In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're 
              going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.George: If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how 
              incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your 
              friend.Jerry: I know. It's like X-ray vision.George: If we could just harness this power and use it for our 
              own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.Newman enters.Newman: I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You 
              gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.Jerry: Can't do it Newman.Newman: But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post 
              office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about 
              me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me 
              two hours.Jerry: Not going to happen.Newman: (Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. 
              You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you 
              control the mail, you control... information.In the car service car.Jerry: Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.Driver (The same driver as before): Pardon me sir?Jerry: I said pull over by the stop sign.Driver: I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a 
              damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. 
              My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. 
              Metalla-something.Kramer: -ca.Driver: Huh?George: What?Jerry: ca.George: ah.Driver: My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.Elaine gets in. The driver looks up and notices her. He gets angry.A moment later, the group gets out of the car.Driver: Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.Kramer shuts the door and the car takes off, squeeling the tires.At the party.Jerry: You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so 
              I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.Laura sees the group and gets up. She points to her watch.Jerry: I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand 
              in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the 
              guy you helped become the first ball man.Kramer and Laura start signing to each other. We see confusion 
              from them as they are signing. George puts his forhead on his hand.Kramer: She doesn't know what she's talking about.Todd: Guys you made it.George: Hey hey.Todd: Sorry to hear about Gwen.George: Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up 
              with me?Todd: Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk 
              to her. Look George, I'm friends with both of you. I can't betray 
              her confidence by telling you anything.George: I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You 
              should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll 
              even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no 
              chance of me overhearing anything.Todd: You are so centered.George: (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are 
              they saying?Gwen and Todd talk. Laura makes hand signs and Kramer translates.Kramer: "Hi Gwen, hi tide."Jerry: Hi tide?Kramer: Hi Todd.Kramer: "You've got something between your teeth"George: What?Kramer: No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love 
              carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea 
              soup." So do I.Elaine: She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow 
              afternoon?Jerry: No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.Gwen: I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.Todd: Maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we 
              can sweep together.Kramer: "Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."George: What?Kramer: "You want me to sleep with you?"Todd: I don't want to sweep alone.Kramer: He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, 
              oh boy, "love to."George walks across the room over to them.George: So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are 
              going to sleep together?Gwen: What? You're crazy.Kramer: "What? You're crazy."George: I heard your whole conversation.Gwen: How?Kramer: "How?"George: (looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's 
              sleep together.Gwen: No I didn't. I said "sweep". Let's sweep together, 
              you know with a broom. Cleaning up.Kramer: "... with a broom, cleaning up."George: Sweep?Gwen: Yes sweep.Kramer: "Yes sweep."George: Cut it.Kramer: George says "Cut it."George: Cut it.Kramer: George is saying "Cut it."George: Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop 
              signing? She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep 
              together."Laura's mouth is wide open. She looks at Kramer and points to George. 
              She is mad at Kramer. Aparently she did say sweep and Kramer mis-translated. 
              She signs to Kramer.Kramer: I know how to sign.Kramer and Laura are arguing back and forth with sign language. 
              They are gesturing signs fiercely. One of Laura's signs causes her 
              hand to swing backwards and hit George in the face.George: Ow. My eye, my eye.(Commercial)At the tennis court.Elaine: It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in 
              the finals.Jerry: I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.Kramer is sitting poised on the sideline. He waves back to the 
              group. George and Elaine gives him a thumbs up. The two players 
              hit the ball back and forth. The ball lands in the net. Kramer springs 
              into action running toward the ball and runs into Monica Sellas. 
              Monica falls to the ground in pain.Jerry: Thus ends the great ball man experiment.Laura gets into the car service car.Driver (The same driver as before): You with the tennis center?Laura: Yep.Driver: Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Sellas. Wasn't 
              that something.Laura. I'm deaf.Driver: Oh. (Very suspicious look on his face.)

        Jerry I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You 
        know. Unless the waiter's not too sharp, then you got to total 
        it up. Sometimes they have to come over, "Do you want the 
        check?" "No, I want to be pen pals. Can't you see what I'm 
        doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people."

        Elaine Hmm!

        George Fantastic!

        Jerry I told you. How good is this?

        George Good.

        Jerry How good?

        George Very good.

        Elaine They got blue berries. And there's real blue berries. What 
        kind did you get?

        Jerry Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and they put it 
        in.

        Elaine Let me test-taste that.

        Jerry Huh? Huh?

        Elaine Hmm! Rico!

        Jerry Suave! And it's non-fat!

        George See, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.

        Elaine You want to taste mine?

        George Oh, you want to taste mine.

        Elaine No, I don't.

        George Okay, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me 
        some of yours.

        Elaine All right, let's just forget it.

        Jerry You know, Kramer's going to clean up on this place.

        George What do you mean?

        Jerry He invested in it.

        George No kidding?

        Jerry Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so 
        *beep*ing good.

        Lady Jerry!

        Jerry Oh, I'm sorry.

        Elaine All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little 
        
        bit more, okay?

        George Oh, god. Look who's here.

        Jerry Who is it?

        George This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a 
        big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.

        Jerry Oh, really?

        Lloyd Hey, George!

        George Hey! Lloyd! My friend Jerry.

        L&J Hi!

        Lloyd So, I hear you're living back home now?

        George Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.

        Lloyd Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, 
        huh? Something wrong with your arm?

        George Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I bumped my elbow on a 
        desk and injured something. And now it sort of moves 
        involuntarily.

        Lloyd Wow, that's a bitch, huh? 

        Lloyd So, how are your parents doing?

        George Oh, pretty good.

        Lloyd This place does some business, huh?

        George Yeah, this is my first time here.

        Lloyd Hey, she's a doll.

        Elaine Hi!

        George Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd.

        Elaine Hi!

        Lloyd Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you.

        Elaine Nice to meet you, too!

        Lloyd Well, I'm really sorry I got to run now. Well, take it easy, 
        huh, George?

        George Yeah! Yeah.

        Elaine Boy, he is really cute!

        George He's a jerk.

        Jerry He's gone, George.

        George All right. All right.

        Kramer So, there were a lot of people there, huh?

        Jerry Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.

        Kramer Yeah.

        Jerry They're doing an incredible business.

        Kramer Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.

        Jerry How did you know?

        Kramer Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable 
        texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.

        Jerry Yeah?

        Elaine Buzz me.

        Jerry Oh. Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed 
        like ten new minutes. 

        Kramer Yeah, but did you tape it?

        Jerry Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. 
        Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your 
        feet up?

        Kramer Yes!

        Jerry I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.

        Elaine Hey!

        Kramer Hey!

        Jerry What's the matter?

        Elaine Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.

        Jerry Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a 
        
        person could still make a mistake like that.

        Kramer Yow!

        Elaine What?

        Kramer Well, you're getting heavy. Yeah, you look like you put on 
        five, ten pounds. 


        Jerry Kramer!

        Kramer I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky 
        yourself, buddy.

        Jerry Me?

        Kramer Yeah.

        Jerry No.

        Elaine Where's your bathroom scale? Oh my god, I've gained seven 
        pounds.

        Jerry I've gained eight.

        Kramer I told you.

        Elaine Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 
        pounds?

        Jerry How did I gain eight?

        Elaine I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I 
        haven't been eating anything different.

        Jerry Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that 
        yogurt.

        Kramer No, no, no. That's hundred percent yogurt.

        Jerry Well, how else could this have happened?

        Kramer Well, maybe it's the Oreos.

        Elaine I don't eat Oreos.

        Kramer You don't eat Oreos? The way you break them open? 
        You're ~ practically having sex with them.

        Jerry What about me?

        Kramer You? You're getting old.

        Jerry Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.

        Kramer Oh, guess again, Tubby!

        Elaine Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.

        Jerry There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of 
        thing.

        Elaine Gasp! I've got it.

        Kramer What?

        Elaine I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.

        Kramer Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubby, if that yogurt has fat in it, 
        I 
        will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.

        Jerry Well, let's start the insanity.

        Kramer Giddy-up!

        Dad Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. You ever see Tommy 
        Tune dancing?

        George No.

        Mom I like tap dancing.

        Dad Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.

        Mom Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.

        George What's for supper?

        Mom Somebody's at the door.

        Dad Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.

        Mom Lloyd?

        Lloyd Hello, Mrs. Costanza.

        Mom Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.

        Dad Hey! Lloyd!

        Mom What are you doing here?

        Lloyd Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother, and 
        so I thought I'd drop by and say, "Hello".

        Mom Georgie. Come here and say hello.

        Dad How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for 
        Dinkins now.

        Lloyd That's right. Hey, George.

        George Hey, Lloyd. How's it going?

        Lloyd I ran into George yesterday in the city.

        Mom Ow! What's the matter with you?

        Lloyd So, uh, how's the arm, huh?

        George Oh, it's good. It's good.

        Mom What's the matter with your arm?

        George Nothing.

        Lloyd Oh, his arm moves like this.

        Dad Your arm moves like this?

        George Yeah.

        Dad I never seen your arm move like this.

        Mom Me, either.

        George Well, it comes and goes.

        Dad It's like some kind of a spasm.

        Lloyd Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, 
        and he said he had the best. So, I made an appointment for 
        you. Dr. Dekter.

        Mom Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?

        Dad You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You 
        discussed George with the mayor of New York?

        Mom Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.

        George You know, Lloyd, I've been to the doctor - there's really 
        nothing they can do.

        Dad Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what 
        kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?

        George All right. All right. I'll go.

        Lloyd Well, that's great. And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the 
        
        diagnosis.

        Elaine Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. Okay. 
        I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have 
        to drive there.

        Jerry And they said they can do it?

        Elaine Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.

        Jerry All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a 
        specimen.

        Elaine Hm-hmm.

        Lady Well, I hope you're satisfied.

        Jerry What?

        Lady Every word out of my son's mouth now is *beep*, *beep*, 
        *beep*. You know what he said to me five minutes ago? 
        Where's my *beep*ing cupcake?

        Jerry Gee, I'm really sorry.

        Lady He wants to be like you because you're a comedian. Maybe 
        you could talk to him?

        Jerry I'd be happy to.

        Lady Thank you.

        Jerry Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's yogurt 
        at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?

        Lady No *beep*ing way!

        Lloyd Well, it was very nice seeing you again.

        Mom Oh, it was good seeing you.

        Lloyd Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw 
        you with the other day?

        George Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.


        Mom You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?

        Lloyd She is. She is. How about giving me her number?

        George Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.

        Mom She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benice.

        Lloyd Oh, great. Thanks a lot!

        George Yeah!

        Lloyd So long.

        Mom Bye! Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?

        Newman Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!" 
        And I 
        sent her to the back of the line!

        Jerry Hello, Newman.

        Newman Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And 
        it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my 
        whole life! And it's finally here!

        Owner Hey, Seinfeld. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop using obscenities 
        
        around my son, huh?

        Jerry It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.

        Elaine I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, 
        right?

        Owner That's right. 

        Elaine 'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have 
        
        any fat.

        Owner Yeah, well, there is no fat.

        Newman Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.

        Elaine Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!

        Jerry How's it doing?

        Elaine Not too good.

        Kramer Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.

        Jerry So what.

        Kramer It changes the molecules.

        Jerry Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.

        Kramer Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.

        Jerry You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking 
        back.

        Elaine Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.

        Labbie Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please?

        Elaine Yeah. Oh, does it matter if it's melted?

        Labbie No! You know, this is going to take a couple of days.

        Elaine That's okay.

        Kramer Hello, there.

        Labbette Hello!

        Kramer Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!

        Jerry What do you got there?

        Labbie Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a 
        cholesterol work up on it.

        Jerry Oh.

        Elaine Okay, I'm done.

        Labbette It was really nice meeting you.

        Kramer Well, the pleasure's all mine.

        Jerry You can't take that chemist out.

        Kramer Why not?

        Jerry Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.

        Kramer I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.

        Jerry Well, I think the whole thing stinks.

        Elaine It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.

        Jerry That's enough.

        Elaine What?

        Jerry Well, with the smells.

        George So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. 
        He's just trying to humiliate me.

        Jerry Uh-huh.

        George And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.

        Jerry Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office 
        doing this? He's going to think you're a mental patient.

        George I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. 
        This is nothing to me. My whole life is a lie.

        Elaine Hey!

        G&J Hey.

        Elaine So, guess who called me.

        George Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?

        Elaine We're going out tomorrow night.

        George Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell 
        him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving 
        involuntarily ever since.

        Elaine I can't say that.

        George Why not?

        Elaine What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?

        George So, you're taking his side?

        Elaine No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always 
        have that between us.

        George Already you're marrying this guy?

        Elaine You never know.

        George All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.

        Elaine All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? 
        Every time we see you you're going to be walking around 
        going like this? Even you can't keep that up.

        Jerry No, I believe he can.

        Lady Hi!

        Jerry Hi!

        Lady You know Jerry.

        Son Of course, he's the funny *beep*er.

        Lady See!

        Jerry Listen, Matthew, I want to explain something to you. Now, 
        cursing is not something that most comedians do.

        Son You did it.

        Jerry That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it 
        since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue 
        cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you 
        grow up. Excuse me one second.

        Elaine You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.

        George Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.

        Elaine He tells him which soap to use.

        Jerry What the *beep* are you doing? You little piece of *beep*.

        Labbette Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.

        Kramer Where's the lights. Whoa!

        Labbette How about this?

        Kramer Yeah! Bunsen burner. You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.

        Labbette It's delicious.

        Kramer I hear you.


        Labbette Non-fat?

        Kramer Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?

        Labbette No.

        Kramer Well, this is in case there's a tie!

        Elaine Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and 
        it's kind of got this involuntarily movement. Some sort of a 
        spasm. So, anyway, you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?

        Lloyd Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.

        Elaine Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for 
        mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody 
        should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.

        Lloyd Name tags, hmm?

        Elaine Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a 
        small town.

        Lloyd Maybe I'll mention that to him.

        Elaine Really? Wow!

        Lloyd You sure you don't want any yogurt?

        Elaine No, I'm watching my weight.

        Lloyd Well, it's nonfat.

        Elaine Yeah, so they say.

        Lloyd Well, should we go?

        Elaine Yeah. Okay.

        Elaine Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? 
        Because he thinks I'm too fat.

        Jerry He said that?

        Elaine No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm 
        around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on 
        one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a 
        lot of woman!"

        Kramer Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?

        Jerry No, but I expect to hear anytime.

        Kramer Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

        Jerry Why do you say that?

        Kramer No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?

        Elaine No. What about him?

        Kramer You didn't hear?

        Elaine Un-huh.

        Kramer He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear 
        name tags.

        Jerry Name tags?

        Kramer Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
        Jerry Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw 
        wilding today? Herb!"

        Kramer He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has 
        already stated it could cost him the election. Name tags!

        Jerry Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, really? Okay, thank you 
        very much. Bye-bye. Well, the yogurt verdict is in. Fat!

        Kramer Yeow!

        George The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. I 
        can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, oh!

        Doctor Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.

        George Please, doctor.

        Doctor I've examined you.

        George Yes.

        Doctor I've looked at your X-rays.

        George Uh-huh.

        Doctor And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.

        George Hmm. Really? Nothing?

        Doctor Nothing that would indicate involuntary spasms.

        George Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?

        Doctor No, not really.

        George How so?

        Doctor May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?

        George Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see 
        doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's 
        absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person 
        would do a thing like that?

        Doctor I don't know what kind of a person would do something like 
        that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. 
        A person who has no regard for wasting other people's 
        valuable time. Good-bye.

        George Now, see here, doctor.

        Doctor I said, good-bye.

        George Fine. Ow!

        Elaine Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.

        Jerry Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to 
        be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, 
        look, wait a second, Kramer, turn that up.

        Kramer Okay.

        News Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received 
        some startling news today when his cholesterol count turned 
        out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the 
        minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another 
        development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd 
        Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag 
        fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy 
        Giuliani is about to make a statement.

        Giuliani It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I 
        
        normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I 
        exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that 
        I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat.

        Jerry Yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even 
        know it. 

        Elaine Now look what you've done.

        Jerry Well, we've got to do something. I'm calling Giuliani's 
        headquarters.

        George Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks 
        anybody would be interested in an idea like that.

        Dad I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. 
        Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How 
        are 
        you doing, Joe?" Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought 
        you said it went away.

        George I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. And . . .

        Mom Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.

        Giuliani My campaign staff has received some very disturbing 
        information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being 
        sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm 
        elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a 
        special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you, 
        my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do 
        everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat 
        yogurt.

        Jerry The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.

        George Phew!

        Elaine Oh, it stinks.

        Kramer Mine, too. I got one more day. 

        Jerry I can't eat this.

        Newman Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.

        Jerry It had fat in it, it's not good for you.

        Newman I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to 
        interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get 
        even with you for this. You can count on it.

        Elaine Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. Apparently 

        some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his 
        cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially 
        reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt 
        scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the 
        election for the Republican. It was the one issue which 
        seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.

        Jerry So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.

        Elaine I wonder what actually happened in that lab.

        Kramer Yeah, me, too.

        Newman I can't eat this.

        Boy Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*!

        [Setting: Night club]

        JERRY: If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems 
        like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. 
        The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, 
        he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed 
        by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, 
        fine. Just keep the music down. And % these women who always fall in love 
        with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's 
        hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped 
        killing people and she goes: "You know sometimes I feel like I don't 
        even know who you are anymore".


        [setting: Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment]

        (Elaine's on the phone with Jerry)

        JERRY: No eight years isn't such a long streak.

        ELAINE: It isn't?

        JERRY: No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.

        ELAINE: Get out!

        JERRY: Not since June 29, 1980.

        ELAINE: You remember the date?

        JERRY: Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's 
        why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George: "Can you believe 
        it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."

        ELAINE: Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, 
        I was wondering if he was normal.

        JERRY: Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same 
        name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.

        ELAINE: Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. 
        I gotta go. (she hangs up)

        JOANNE: Hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop.

        ELAINE: Oh, yeah?

        JOANNE: Yeah. What's his name?

        ELAINE: Joel...

        JOANNE: Joel what?

        ELAINE: Uh... Rifkin.

        MICHAEL: Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?

        ELAINE: Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.

        MICHAEL: Guess you better keep on his good side.

        ELAINE: Very funny. That's very funny.

        JOANNE: I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you.

        ELAINE: All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.

        MICHAEL: Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk 
        of his car...

        ELAINE: (she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend 
        we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's 
        a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about 
        him! Shut up!

        (scene ends)


        [setting: Jerry's]

        ELAINE: The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and 
        I am dating a Joel Rifkin.

        JERRY: But you like your Joel Rifkin.

        ELAINE: Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.

        JERRY: Ask him to change it.

        ELAINE: You can't ask a person to change their name.

        JERRY: Why not?

        ELAINE: Would you change yours?

        JERRY: If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.

        (Kramer enters)

        ELAINE: Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?

        JERRY: Yeah. Eighteen strangles.

        KRAMER: You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. 
        (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine 
        and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was 
        adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves 
        and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)

        ELAINE: You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.

        (Jerry doesn't have the time to open his mouth before Kramer pops in again)

        KRAMER: I'll go.

        ELAINE: O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.

        KRAMER: Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)

        ELAINE: You think I should have asked George?

        JERRY: Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?

        ELAINE: Karen?

        JERRY: Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George 
        that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with 
        him)

        ELAINE: Oh! The Risotto broad.

        JERRY: Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling 
        with them tonight.

        ELAINE: I tought you didn't like double dates.

        JERRY: George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He 
        likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his 
        nondate personality.

        ELAINE: I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the 
        blinds.

        JERRY: He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.

        ELAINE: And you're taking...

        JERRY: Jody the masseuse.

        ELAINE: Hey, did you get a massage yet?

        JERRY: No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a 
        massage?

        ELAINE: Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them 
        on dates.

        JERRY: Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.

        ELAINE: So what?

        JERRY: Well it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, 
        but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.

        (scene ends)


        [setting: The Chinese restaurant (the same as in 'The Chinese Restaurant')]

        (Jerry, Jody, Karen and George sitting at a table. Yes! They got a table!)


        GEORGE: (George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to 
        be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and 
        the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to 
        her: "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, 
        what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"

        KAREN: That is so funny.

        GEORGE: (to Jody) You're listening to this?

        JODI: Yeah. I heard you.

        JERRY: (to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender 
        over here.

        JODI: (to George) So what did she say?

        GEORGE: Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)

        JODI: You just said that you said it.

        GEORGE: Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.

        KAREN: I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you 
        like this.

        JERRY: (touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on 
        wires back here.

        GEORGE: You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting 
        a traffic ticket.

        JODI: How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you 
        saying she's not attractive?

        GEORGE: Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast 
        rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.

        JODI: (to Jerry) Can we go?

        JERRY: Yeah. Let's go.

        KAREN: So soon? (they get up)

        JERRY: Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.

        KAREN: Yeah.

        JODI: Nice meeting you Karen.

        KAREN: Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.

        JODI: Oh yeah.

        GEORGE: Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug 
        but she avoids him)

        JODI: Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away)

        (scene ends)


        [setting: Jerry's place later that night]

        (Jerry and Jody are sitting next to each other on the couch, watching 
        TV)

        JERRY: I strained my neck last night.

        JODI: Really, how?

        JERRY: I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head 
        from side to side. It didn't work.

        JODI: So what's the deal with your friend George?

        JERRY: No deal. Why?

        JODI: What was all that "attractive women not getting tickets" 
        nonsense?

        JERRY: He was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.

        JODI: I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.

        JERRY: Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand 
        and put it on his shoulder)

        JODI: Did you see the way that he was eating?

        JERRY: Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. 
        She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)

        JODI: I have to tell you, I really don't like him.

        JERRY: Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other 
        shoulder)

        JODI: It's just I hate that type.

        JERRY: Yeah, he's a bad seed.

        JODI: Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)

        JERRY: What are you doing?

        JODI: What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...)

        [setting: The Chinese restaurant]

        (George and Karen are still at the table, they're about to leave)

        GEORGE: So, what do you think?

        KAREN: Really enjoyed it.

        GEORGE: Jody's nice.

        KAREN: She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.

        GEORGE: You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.

        KAREN: Yeah

        GEORGE: I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?

        KAREN: You were *extremely* personable.

        GEORGE: I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. 
        Did you pick up anything?

        KAREN: I didn't pick up anything.

        GEORGE: The second time I sent the noodle back, I tought she made a face...

        KAREN: I didn't see a face.

        GEORGE: I tought I saw a face.

        KAREN: Anyhow, what is the difference?

        GEORGE: No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.

        KAREN: George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you 
        know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' 
        while saying: "instead of the movie...")

        GEORGE: He he he he

        KAREN: Ah ah ah ah

        GEORGE: So you think she likes me?

        [setting: Elaine's place]

        (She's sitting on the couch, reading, and Joel is coming quietly behind 
        her to massage her neck.)

        ELAINE: (as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?

        JOEL: Massaging your neck.

        ELAINE: Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.

        JOEL: Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading 
        as he sits beside her)

        ELAINE: Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Dion 
        these days. What a cool name, Dion. If I were gonna change my name, I'd 
        go with Dion.

        JOEL: Dion Benes?

        ELAINE: Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was 
        you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- 
        Dion Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.

        JOEL: D-Dion Rifkin?

        ELAINE: Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's 
        see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and 
        loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, 
        it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! 
        Please, it would be so great!

        JOEL: Elaine! What is going on?

        (Jerry and George at a booth)

        GEORGE: She stayed over?

        JERRY: Yeah. (disappointed)

        GEORGE: The sex wasn't so good?

        JERRY: No. The sex was fabulous.

        GEORGE: So?

        JERRY: I want the massage!

        GEORGE: Did you ask her?

        JERRY: I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it 
        away immediately, she's not into it.

        GEORGE: Why not?

        JERRY: I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.

        GEORGE: So we had a good time... the four of us.

        JERRY: Yeah.

        GEORGE: We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.

        JERRY: Yeah.

        GEORGE: What did Jodi say?

        JERRY: She had a good time.

        GEORGE: Is that it?

        JERRY: Pretty much.

        GEORGE: Did she say anything about, uh...

        JERRY: What?

        GEORGE: Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.

        JERRY: Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)

        GEORGE: You just hesitated.

        JERRY: I was blowing on the coffee.

        GEORGE: She didn't like me?

        JERRY: Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with 
        her.

        GEORGE: So she doesn't like me?

        JERRY: No.

        GEORGE: She said that?

        JERRY: Yes.

        GEORGE: She told you she doesn't like me!

        JERRY: Yes.

        GEORGE: What were her exact--

        JERRY: "I don't like him."

        GEORGE: Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?

        JERRY: Not everybody likes everybody!

        GEORGE: I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?

        JERRY: You were very nice!

        GEORGE: I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said 
        about her sister?

        JERRY: It has nothing to do with her sister.

        GEORGE: I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting 
        traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking!

        JERRY: Oh no. That was the dry heaves.

        (Jodi is in front of Jerry's door)

        JERRY: Jodi.

        JODI: Hey, Jerry.

        GEORGE: Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like: it's so great to be all here)

        JERRY: What are you doing here?

        JODI: I was giving Kramer a massage.

        JERRY: Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)

        JODI: I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.

        GEORGE: Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.

        JODI: No that's O.K.

        GEORGE: Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. 
        Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and 
        she has no choice but to follow him)

        JERRY: I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer 
        comes out of his in a bathrobe)

        KRAMER: Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!

        JERRY: Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage 
        from her yet!

        KRAMER: You don't know what you're missing buddy.

        [setting: street in front of Jerry's building]

        (George and Jodi)

        GEORGE: No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. 
        I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into 
        themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let 
        me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here 
        we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say 
        hello to your sister for me.

        JODI: You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep 
        talking to Jodi)

        GEORGE: Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't 
        mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from 
        the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)

        (Kramer is lying on the couch as Jerry is cutting a block of cheese on 
        the kitchen counter)

        KRAMER: (Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First 
        she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean 
        sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil 
        over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs 
        with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs 
        it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) 
        ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain 
        yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)

        JERRY: So you had a good time.

        KRAMER: Oh... yeah...

        JERRY: Enjoyed yourself.

        KRAMER: Very... much...

        JERRY: All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's 
        legs and throws him down the couch)

        KRAMER: What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)

        JERRY: The massages are out!

        KRAMER: Wha--

        JERRY: Ahh!!! They're out!

        KRAMER: Why?!

        JERRY: Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.

        KRAMER: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see 
        I'm burned out!


        JERRY: I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)

        KRAMER: Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)

        JERRY: Don't you ever talk about her like that!

        KRAMER: But why?

        JERRY: That's final!!!

        JOEL: Yeah. Why? Is that weird?

        ELAINE: No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's 
        this?

        JOEL: That's my mother.

        ELAINE: Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.

        JOEL: No, there's no resemblance.

        ELAINE: Yeah, there is, right here you see--

        JOEL: Elaine, I was adopted.

        ELAINE: (pause) Oh. That's nice.

        KRAMER: (to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.

        TICKET MAN: Here it is. I need some I.D.

        KRAMER: Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.

        TICKET MAN: Well, I can't give it to you then.

        KRAMER: Are you kidding me?

        TICKET MAN: I'm afraid not.

        KRAMER: Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.

        TICKET MAN: I'm sorry. I need proof.

        KRAMER: Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got 
        nothing to do all day.

        TICKET MAN: Neither do I. But without I.D., I need confirmation from the 
        person who left the ticket.

        crowd stops cheering and we see a football player distracted from the 
        game while hearing the announcer saying Joel Rifkin)

        JOEL: Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)

        ELAINE: (to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.

        (Kramer enters, moaning)

        KRAMER: Oh, God.

        JERRY: What's the matter with you?

        KRAMER: Jerry, I need another massage!

        JERRY: You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?

        KRAMER: Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know 
        what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.

        JERRY: Oh please.

        KRAMER: And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into 
        the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! It's killing 
        me Jerry!

        JERRY: Well, did you get the ball?

        KRAMER: Oh I got the ball.

        JERRY: Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.

        KRAMER: Well, It's quite a thrill.

        JERRY: Why don't you get somebody else?

        KRAMER: Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.

        JERRY: Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if 
        and's or but's".

        KRAMER: What about my massage?

        JERRY: Ask Newman.

        down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?

        KAREN: Of course.

        GEORGE: No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's 
        seen a massage table.

        KAREN: What, do you think I've never had a massage before?

        GEORGE: Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!

        KAREN: George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.

        GEORGE: I wanna know what I did to this woman.

        KAREN: What, you got a little thing for her?

        GEORGE: No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous 
        that we should try and like each other.

        KAREN: What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? 
        Does everybody in the world have to like you?

        GEORGE: Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!

        JOEL: After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going 
        away.

        ELAINE: Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing 
        to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.

        JOEL: Sure?

        ELAINE: (she fakes a strangling) RRR...

        JOEL: O.K. you got your list?

        ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.

        JOEL: Right.

        ELAINE: O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.

        JOEL: O.K.

        ELAINE: O.K. You start. What's your first choice?

        JOEL: Stuart.

        ELAINE: (right away) No. Second choice.

        JOEL: Stu--Stuart's no good?

        ELAINE: I've never met a normal guy named Stuart.

        JOEL: O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.


        ELAINE: (repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.

        JOEL: All right. Oh, Hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third 
        choice.

        ELAINE: Great...

        JOEL: Alex.

        ELAINE: I gotta tell you, I have a bad association with the name Alex.

        JOEL: Bad bad association?

        ELAINE: Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he 
        was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go: "Ahh!". 
        I mean every two seconds: "Ahh!". And he would take like 40 
        sips and after everyone: "Ahh!". I had to drop the class.

        JODI: Hey.

        JERRY: Hi.

        JODI: Hi. (kissing) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop 
        off my stuff before I came over.

        JERRY: Ah, no problem. That's fine.

        JODI: What's with this music?

        JERRY: That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. 
        Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he 
        starts to install the table)

        JODI: What are you doing?

        JERRY: Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell 
        you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.

        JODI: Actually, I should get a new one.

        JERRY: Nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)

        JODI: So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)

        JERRY: Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts 
        to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, 
        uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his 
        shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. 
        That's very nice.

        JODI: (she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.

        JERRY: Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them 
        on his shoulders)

        JODI: I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)

        JERRY: No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)

        JODI: No, I can't!

        JERRY: Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder 
        and he falls right off the table)

        GEORGE: You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. 
        Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. I just know if I 
        could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) 
        I've got to.

        KAREN: You're going now?

        GEORGE: I think I can still catch her.

        KAREN: All right George. I have had just about enough of this.

        GEORGE: What? What are you talking about.

        KAREN: I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with 
        her!

        GEORGE: I know. I know.

        KAREN: Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. 
        Who are you gonna pick?

        GEORGE: (he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his 
        knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't 
        stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)

        JOEL: Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!

        ELAINE: Ellis and Alex aren't even close.

        JOEL: NO, NO. COME ON!

        JERRY: Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your 
        table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're 
        a massage teaser.

        JODI: Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible 
        massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again 
        but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.

        JERRY: Fine. Go.

        GEORGE: Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?

        JERRY: What for?

        GEORGE: We need to talk.

        JERRY: *You* need to talk?

        JODI: We have nothing to talk about.

        GEORGE: Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She 
        doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.

        JERRY: George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of 
        me.

        GEORGE: (he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... 
        This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.

        JERRY: What?

        GEORGE: She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.

        JERRY: I can see that.

        JODI: I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.

        JERRY: Don't worry. (she leaves)

        GEORGE: A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.

        JERRY: You're a lucky guy.

        GEORGE: I got to go after her.

        JERRY: George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)

        GEORGE: JODI! (he starts running after her)

        Opening Monologue: The bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, 
        most despised vehicle on the road. Isn't it? You ever notice when you 
        get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, 
        come on.' The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are 
        just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's like this huge metal ass taking 
        up the whole wind shield of your car. When it pulls out it even sounds 
        like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa. (acts like he is trying 
        to get out of a car and makes the sound of a bus/guy starting to get going)

        (scene ends)


        [Setting: Jerry and George on a Bus]

        GEORGE: It's just not good, it's not good.

        JERRY: It's not good.

        GEORGE: I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got 
        out to eat, we both read newspapers.

        JERRY: Well at breakfast everybody reads.

        GEORGE: No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.

        JERRY: You read during lunch?

        GEORGE: Ya

        JERRY: Oh, well.

        GEORGE: There's nothing to talk about.

        JERRY: Ya, what's there to talk about.

        GEORGE: Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing 
        to talk about.

        JERRY: Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?

        GEORGE: She knows there is nothing to talk about.

        JERRY: At least you'll be talking.

        GEORGE: Oh shut up.

        (Al comes onto the bus)

        AL: Hey, look who's here.

        JERRY: Hey, Al.

        GEORGE: Hey, Al. How's it going?

        AL: (extremely happy) Deeply in love. We have soo many things to talk 
        about. Sometimes we'll talk all night, till the sun comes up (pauses in 
        his happiness; to George) so how about you?

        GEORGE: Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.

        AL: Great girl.

        GEORGE: We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.

        JERRY: Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.

        AL: (to Jerry) Oh did you hear about Fulton?

        JERRY: Ya.

        AL: I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago (looking at Jerry) 
        think he'd really like you to come visit.

        JERRY: Me?

        AL: Ya, he said he could use a good laugh.

        GEORGE: What about me?

        AL: (to George) He didn't mention you. (Looks toward the front of the 
        bus) This is my stop. Uh see ya.

        GEORGE: Ya

        JERRY: Ya, see ya.

        (Al leaves)

        GEORGE: Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, 
        you shouldn't say anything at all.

        JERRY: (points to George) Ya.

        (Scene Ends)


        [Setting: Jerry's apartment]

        (Jerry and George enter the apartment)

        GEORGE: I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.

        JERRY: Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? 
        Come on, come with me. 

        GEORGE: Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. 
        I..I make em feel worse.

        JERRY: Oh, stop it.

        GEORGE: Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going 
        to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to 
        lose what do they care?

        JERRY: So you're not gonna come?

        GEORGE: No but say hello for me.

        (Kramer and Mickey enter)

        KRAMER: Hey!

        JERRY: Hey! Hey Mick.

        MICKEY: Hey Jerry.

        KRAMER: What's doing?

        JERRY: Nothing, what's doing with you?

        KRAMER: Same old, same old.

        JERRY: George this is Mickey.

        GEORGE: Hi, nice to meet you.

        (George and Mickey shake hands)

        MICKEY: Pleasure.


        JERRY: How's work going you guys?

        MICKEY: Lets not even talk about it.

        GEORGE: (to Kramer) You got a job?

        KRAMER: Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 
        'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and 
        I stand in for the kids father.

        MICKEY: (to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. 
        The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now 
        he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can 
        do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna 
        be out on my ass doing that paralegal crap.

        JERRY: How do you stop a kid from growing?

        KRAMER: (to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes. 
        

        MICKEY: I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid 
        mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.

        KRAMER: (to Mickey) What about lifts?

        MICKEY: (to Kramer) Out of the question. 

        GEORGE: (to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?

        (Mickey grabs the counter with rage on his face, Jerry does a form of 
        gulp)

        MICKEY: (turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's 
        little people, you got that?

        KRAMER: Easy Mickey, easy. 

        GEORGE: Yap..

        KRAMER: All right we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?

        JERRY: I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.

        KRAMER: (on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.

        (Kramer and Mickey leave Jerry's apartment and enter the hallway)

        KRAMER: Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You 
        gotta get some lifts for your shoes.

        MICKEY: Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is 
        just not done.

        KRAMER: You wanna keep your job don't you?

        MICKEY: Ya but..

        (Kramer interrupts him)

        KRAMER: YAH! No Buts

        MICKEY: Kramer

        (Kramer interrupts again)

        KRAMER: (with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH!

        (Scene Ends)


        [Fulton's Hospital Room]

        (Fulton lying in the Hospital Bed, Jerry Enters)

        JERRY: Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.

        FULTON: Hey Jerry, good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh.

        JERRY: Who couldn't.

        FULTON: I haven't cracked a smile in months.

        JERRY: Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you 
        crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar 
        Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not 
        amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't 
        a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very 
        cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton 
        not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time 
        for a visit.

        FULTON: It's a fine time.

        JERRY: Oh, all right ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, 
        and they're all staring at him....

        (Scene Ends)


        [Monk's]

        (George and Daphne sitting in a booth reading the paper)

        GEORGE: (sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?

        DAPHNE: Eggs are eggs.

        GEORGE: (Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. 
        (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you 
        could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Daphne

        DAPHNE: (correcting George) Daphne.

        GEORGE: Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...

        DAPHNE: (interrupts and hurriedly puts down her paper) Oh, I forgot to 
        tell you. Al Netchie called me today.

        GEORGE: Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?

        DAPHNE: He told me not to get involved with you.

        GEORGE: What?

        DAPHNE: Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd 
        just wind up (reaches out and lightly slaps George's hand) hurting me. 
        

        GEORGE: He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare 
        he say something like that.

        DAPHNE: Is it true?

        GEORGE: Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions 
        in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature 
        manner, but those days are well behind me.

        [Setting: ABC Studios]

        (All My Children Set)

        SON: How long are you going to be away for Daddy?

        FATHER: I'm not really going away, I told you, I'll be back every other 
        weekend.

        SON: Don't go Daddy, don't go.

        FATHER: Now Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much, but 
        sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.

        DIRECTOR: (walks into the scene) ...and there's your scene. Stand-ins

        KRAMER: Yo

        STAGE HAND (Larry David's voice): All right you guys get on their spots 
        so we can fix the lights.

        (Mickey and Kramer walk onto the set and get into positions)

        KRAMER: (taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.

        MICKEY: (quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy?

        KRAMER: (trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really 
        going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.

        MICKEY: (tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go.

        KRAMER: Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. 
        But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.

        (Kramer and Mickey go to hug and Kramer's pipe hits Mickey in the face)

        MICKEY: Ah! (pauses for the hug) all right (Kramer still holding on) all 
        right! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him)

        DIRECTOR: Ok everybody that's lunch... one hour.

        (The director pauses and looks at Mickey as if something is different)

        KRAMER: How do those lifts feel?

        MICKEY: Quiet.

        TAMMY: Hi guys.

        MICKEY: Hey Tammy.

        TAMMY: Hey, you look different. Have you been working out?

        MICKEY: (looks at Kramer) Not that I know of.

        TAMMY: Well whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it you look great.

        MICKEY: How about lunch?


        TAMMY: OH I can't today, but um I see it our future. (starts to leave) 
        See ya Kramer.

        KRAMER: Ya.

        TAMMY: Bye Mickey

        KRAMER: Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)

        KRAMER & MICKEY: Ya!

        MICKEY: All of a sudden.

        KRAMER: What?

        JOHNNY: Hey Mick.

        MICKEY: How you doin' Johnny?

        JOHNNY: What gives...what's going on? Goin' out with Tammy?

        MICKEY: Maybe. What's it to you?

        JOHNNY: Somethin' different about you.

        MICKEY: I got my hair cut that's all (turns to look at Kramer)

        JOHNNY: Nah, that's not it. Something else... Ya you look different.

        (Kramer starts eating a sandwich)

        MICKEY: You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.

        JOHNNY: I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. (walking away) I'll 
        find out.

        (Kramer and Mickey look at each other, Mickey makes a pointing motion 
        as if to reference the conversation with Johnny, Kramer shakes his head 
        no.)


        [Back to Jerry with Fulton]

        JERRY: ..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Pachyderm, you remember 
        the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up 
        the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're 
        steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling 
        em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the 
        air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a 
        breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It 
        was really, really, funny.

        (Phil Enters)

        PHIL: Hey Jerry.

        JERRY: Hey Phil how you doing?

        PHIL: You look terrific.

        JERRY: I got my health.

        PHIL: Well, that's the most important thing. (to Fulton) Hey how ya doing 
        Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane! (Fulton looks at him still stone faced 
        and not amused. To Jerry) How's he doing?

        JERRY: (wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.

        (Scene Ends)


        [Setting: Jerry's Apartment]

        (Jerry and Elaine)

        ELAINE: You should have told that story about Pachyderm dropping the pizza.

        (Buzzer)

        JERRY: I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?

        GEORGE: (on the speaker) Ya

        JERRY: Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what 
        as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest 
        guys.

        ELAINE: Do I know him?

        JERRY: No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could 
        envision you going out with him.

        ELAINE: If you were a woman would you go out with him?

        JERRY: If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet 
        to come in.

        ELAINE: (laughs) Ya, I bet you would. all right, give him my number.

        JERRY: all right.

        (George Enters)

        GEORGE: This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells 
        Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'

        JERRY: What?

        GEORGE: Ya. That's what she told me.

        ELAINE: Why?

        GEORGE: Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.

        ELAINE: Is she?

        GEORGE: Of course.

        ELAINE: So?

        GEORGE: Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.

        ELAINE: Maybe he likes her.

        GEORGE: Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break 
        up with her when she told me.

        JERRY: So what are you gonna do?

        GEORGE: Well I can't break up with her now.

        JERRY: Why?

        GEORGE: Because he said I was going to.

        ELAINE: So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?

        GEORGE: Yes, I am.

        JERRY: Ya, I could see that.

        GEORGE: I don't see any way around it.

        JERRY: No, me either.

        GEORGE: What choice do I have?

        JERRY: None.

        [Setting: ABC Studio Locker Room]

        (Mickey walks in to discover his Locker is open and that his lifts where 
        in there)

        (Scene Ends)


        [Setting: Jerry's Apartment]

        (Jerry and Kramer)

        JERRY: Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit 
        he's taken a turn for the worse.

        KRAMER: Did you tell him the Pachyderm story?

        JERRY: (yelling) Yes I told him the Pachyderm story!

        KRAMER: Maybe I outta go over there.

        JERRY: Towards what end?

        KRAMER: I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len 
        Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, 
        the doctors were amazed at his recovery.

        (Knocking on the Door)

        (Jerry and Kramer walk over to it, Kramer opens it to reveal Mickey)

        KRAMER: Hey.

        JERRY: Hey Mick.

        MICKEY: (to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.

        KRAMER: YAOH!

        MICKEY: (slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my 
        shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened 
        if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.

        KRAMER: Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.

        MICKEY: Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)


        KRAMER: Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)

        MICKEY: You (grabs Kramer)

        (Mickey and Kramer begin a struggle)

        JERRY: (starts pulling them apart) All right break it up, break it up. 
        Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)

        KRAMER: (pacing back and forth) Ya.

        JERRY; Behave yourselves.

        MICKEY: I'm sorry Kramer.

        KRAMER: No no it's all right, it's all right. You're stressed Oout!

        JERRY: (to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?

        MICKEY: Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for 
        the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.

        KRAMER: (whistles) What's he like huh?

        MICKEY: He's a good kid.

        KRAMER: Ya?

        JERRY: So what does he care if you put lifts in?

        MICKEY: You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind 
        of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy 
        tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, 
        I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. 
        (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? 
        Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?

        [Setting: George's car outside Daphne's place]

        DAPHNE: George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper 
        and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, 
        maybe do a little shopping, have lunch...

        GEORGE: (interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be 
        able to stay over tonight. 

        DAPHNE: Why not?

        GEORGE: I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending 
        the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to 
        a father-son picnic, just the two of us.

        DAPHNE: I thought we were going to spend the day together.

        GEORGE: Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought 
        a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the Velcro 
        ball. (laughs)

        DAPHNE: Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, 
        moving in?

        GEORGE: Yes, oh yes very much.

        DAPHNE: Maybe you don't want to move in.

        GEORGE: No, no I do. You know it's just...

        DAPHNE: (interrupting him) Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't 
        have gotten involved with you.

        GEORGE: (angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie 
        is not right! all right I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know 
        what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.

        [Setting: Elaine and Phil in Phil's car outside Elaine's Apartment]

        ELAINE: (Phil cracking up) So then Pachyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, 
        and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can barely hold 'em. I mean 
        he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) 
        the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...

        PHIL: (dying of laughter) I'm peeing in my pants.

        ELAINE: (cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her 
        face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to 
        laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.

        PHIL: Oh, I'm sorry, Oh. What a story.

        ELAINE: I know, I know, I was unbelievable 

        (laughter dying)

        PHIL: Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.

        ELAINE: (wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.

        PHIL: Well this has been one hell of a night.

        ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.

        PHIL: You know, you really are beautiful Elaine.

        ELAINE: Oh, well, (pauses) Good night.

        PHIL: Good night?

        cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response 
        from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll 
        love it, I just did it at the Concord last week. It killed. (waves hello 
        to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you

        ELAINE: Yes.

        JERRY: Are you sure?

        JERRY: There was no mistaking it?

        ELAINE: (looks straight into his eyes) Jerry.

        JERRY: So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") 
        you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound 
        "mmm") then all of sudden...

        ELAINE: Yea.

        ELAINE: It.

        JERRY: Out.


        ELAINE: Out.

        JERRY: Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend 
        of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?

        ELAINE: Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to 
        set me up with?

        (Kramer enters)

        KRAMER: Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?

        ELAINE: (to Kramer) He took it out.

        (Shocked, Kramer acts like he just got a cold shiver down his back)

        KRAMER: Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, 
        they can't breathe in there. It's in human.

        JERRY: It.

        GEORGE: It.

        JERRY: Out.

        GEORGE: Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much 
        time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. 
        (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) all right, Hey come on, get out 
        of here, Daphne gonna be here any minute.

        JERRY: All right I'm going.

        GEORGE: You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely 
        dislike her. 

        JERRY: Well how long you are going to keep this up?

        GEORGE: Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice 
        before he opens his mouth about me again.

        JERRY: You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions 
        these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.

        GEORGE: I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't 
        know what makes me tick.

        JERRY: Yes I do.

        GEORGE: What are you doing?

        what I did wrong.

        JERRY: Well, y..you showed her who you are.

        (Phil turns to see a woman breast feeding her baby down the hallway) 

        PHIL: Oh, look at this, what she's got to breast feed in public.

        KRAMER: I thought paper covered rock?

        MICKEY: Nah, rock flies right through paper.

        KRAMER: What beats rock?

        MICKEY: (looks at his hand) Nothing beats rock.

        TAMMY: Hello.

        MICKEY: So Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch.

        TAMMY: I don't think so.

        MICKEY: Why not? What the hell are you talking about?

        TAMMY: Look Mickey, everybody knows that you're heightening. It's all 
        over the set.

        MICKEY: Wait, wait (goes to grab her arm)

        TAMMY: (recoils) Don't touch me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
        All the progress we made over the years and you go and blow it by pulling 
        a stupid stunt like this.

        MICKEY: Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all 
        because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) 
        (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a 
        month. (to all the little people) I woulda' lost my job. Any one of you 
        would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood 
        in for Punky Brewster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still 
        doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault. 
        (Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about) It was 
        his idea.

        TAMMY: Come on Johnny, let's go get something to eat.

        (all the little people leave including Tammy along with Johnny)

        MICKEY: (in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns 
        and looks at Kramer) AH!

        what makes this all the more difficult. 

        GEORGE: (happily) Difficult?

        for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting 
        someone as a result. George...

        GEORGE: (acting disappointed) Oh, please don't.

        GEORGE: I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't 
        accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)

        RUDY: Uh huh.

        GEORGE: They will get a good home won't they?

        RUDY: Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.

        GEORGE: Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, 
        he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really.

        RUDY: I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.

        GEORGE: Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.

        RUDY: Yea I'm in a good mood here.

        GEORGE: Thank you.

        GEORGE: Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's 
        eyes) that's what he would have wanted.

        KRAMER: Oh, I gotcha (clicks)

        GEORGE: (leaving) That'll do.

        KRAMER: Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business 
        together, selling raincoats.

        GEORGE: Hey that's swell.

        KRAMER: Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.

        GEORGE: Dinner? (grabs Kramer)

        KRAMER: Ya.

        GEORGE: You had dinner with the Seinfelds?

        KRAMER: Yea, last night.

        GEORGE: Was this something you had planned for a while?

        KRAMER: No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly 
        by the seat of his vintage pants.

        GEORGE: (hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!

        KRAMER: Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes 
        George just sold Rudy)

        RUDY: Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. 
        Two for twenty-five dollars.

        KRAMER: Oh I'll take these.

        RUDY: All right

        KRAMER: Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?

        RUDY: Sure that's the Executive. 

        KRAMER: Ya, you have any others?

        RUDY: I wish. They don't make 'em anymore.

        KRAMER: Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be 
        interested?

        RUDY: Very interested

        KRAMER: Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.

        RUDY: Well bring 'em in.

        KRAMER: So you'll buy them?

        RUDY: I don't see what would possibly stop me.

        had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little 
        dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans! 

        JERRY: What are you talking about?

        GEORGE: Mom and Pop Seinfeld


        JERRY: Look I don't know.

        GEORGE: All right I happen to know what they did last night, they had 
        dinner with Kramer.

        JERRY: Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.

        GEORGE: So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents? 
        

        JERRY: That's right.

        GEORGE: Is there something wrong with my parents?

        JERRY: Absolutely

        GEORGE: Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.

        JERRY: These the people you currently live with?

        GEORGE: Yes.

        JERRY: Uh huh

        GEORGE: So are they coming tonight or not?

        JERRY: Look I really don't know what they're plans are.

        GEORGE: Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting 
        if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.

        JERRY: What is that anyway?

        GEORGE: It's a Spanish dish. It's a mlange of fish, an meat with rice. 
        Very tasty.

        JERRY: I-I'll tell 'em

        GEORGE: Hey could you do one other thing for me?

        JERRY: Name it.

        GEORGE: You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little 
        kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that 
        the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry 
        smiles) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as 
        long as they're going (claps)

        JERRY: So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't 
        be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, 
        through the streets of Paris?

        GEORGE: (pause) All right if you think it's too much they don't have to 
        mail the postcards.

        MORTY: Yea

        JACK: Morty, listen I can't get into the garage. 

        MORTY: What do you mean?

        JACK: There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work

        MORTY: You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for 
        fifteen minutes. 

        (Doris enters the scene with Jack)

        DORIS: Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing 
        better to do then worry about his boxes.

        MORTY: You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.

        JACK: Get the hell outta here with your knob.

        DORIS: What does he want from you?

        MORTY: My idiot son could open that garage door.

        JERRY: What did I do?

        MORTY: Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.

        (Jack is seen hanging up his phone)

        MORTY: They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.

        HELEN: Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.

        JERRY: (in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.

        HELEN: How are you gonna get all this done in time?

        MORTY: Don't worry about it.

        JERRY: (in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?



        [Costanza House]

        (George, Estelle and Frank all standing in the kitchen)

        GEORGE: They were drinking champagne in a buggy!

        FRANK: First Kramer, then Elaine?

        GEORGE: Yea

        FRANK: It's a slap in the face.

        ESTELLE: (with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George 
        puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down 
        as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!

        FRANK: What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy 
        and sell 'em like that.

        (Frank leaves the kitchen and moves into the living room)

        ESTELLE: The hell with them.

        GEORGE: (in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The 
        thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.

        (George and Estelle move their way into the living room)

        FRANK: Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits 
        down in his chair)

        GEORGE: (sitting down) Vacation?

        FRANK: You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.

        (Estelle is already sitting next to George on the couch)

        GEORGE: (claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)

        FRANK: But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic. 
        

        GEORGE: The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.

        FRANK: How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, 
        those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! 
        I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and 
        shuts the door)

        GEORGE: (picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.

        FRANK: (looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where 
        the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.



        [Ally outside Rudy's]

        (Rudy has a gasoline bottle and is burning some clothes)

        RUDY: Lousy moth ridden crap.



        [Median Monologue]

        I-I-I'm not crazy about used clothes. I mean they call it vintage, you 
        know to take your mind off of what it really is 'nasty wear.' Oh it's 
        clean you know people wear underwear, ya well they don't wear iron underwear 
        and that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes. I mean I'll 
        move into an apartment after a strange person moves out, why would I wanna 
        move into somebody's pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but 
        it's not because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men 
        wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang on to 
        underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained 
        it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear 
        vapor. W-we don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes 
        out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just 
        go (blows on the mic) and it's gone that it is jus.



        [Movie Theater: Schindler's List]

        (Schindler's List is playing as Jerry and Rachel are making out. Newman 
        is then seen disgusted by this display)



        [Jerry's Apartment]

        (Jerry Enters; Morty and Helen are sitting at the table with a map out)

        JERRY: Hey.

        MORTY: Hey, Jerry.

        HELEN: So how was the movie?

        JERRY: Oh, really good, really good.

        HELEN: And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)

        JERRY: Like that (snaps his fingers)


        MORTY: What about the end, with the list?

        JERRY: Ya that was some list.

        HELEN: What did you think about the black and white?

        JERRY: (confused) The black and white.

        MORTY: The whole movie was in black and white.

        JERRY: Oh yea, I didn't even realize. 

        MORTY: You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.

        JERRY: Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.



        [Rudy's Antique Boutique]

        KRAMER: So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All 
        you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there 
        (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle

        RUDY: Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the 
        coats come in.

        KRAMER; Ya hey I'm on your side.

        (George enters)

        KRAMER: Hey what again?

        GEORGE: I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) 
        Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra 
        Paella. 

        KRAMER: Payaya, ya I'll be there.

        GEORGE: Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say 
        anything bad about your uh your partner.

        KRAMER: No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.

        GEORGE: Twenty-five percent? It was your idea. 

        KRAMER: Yap I know.

        GEORGE: You're doing all the leg work.

        KRAMER: That's right

        GEORGE: He's ripping you off

        KRAMER: You're right he's ripping me off

        GEORGE: If anybody should be getting more it's you.

        KRAMER: He's ripping me off

        GEORGE: Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.

        KRAMER: YAH! (exits)

        RUDY: (coming out of the back-room noticing George) Oh it's you? You're 
        the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.



        [Jerry's Apartment]

        (Morty coming out of the bathroom)

        MORTY: You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five 
        percent?

        HELEN: Well he told you about the place.

        MORTY: So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders 
        fee. You know what a finders fee is? 

        HELEN: You find something you get a fee.

        MORTY: Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.

        HELEN: Well it's too late now.

        MORTY: Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting 
        years for this pay off.

        HELEN: Well you're not gonna say anything.

        (Kramer enters)

        KRAMER: I've been thinking about something.

        MORTY: Ya so have I

        KRAMER: Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.

        MORTY: You don't think it's fair.

        KRAMER: No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing 
        all the leg work.

        MORTY: What leg work?

        KRAMER: Oh, there's leg work.

        MORTY: If anything you're getting too much.

        KRAMER: Too much?!

        MORTY: That's right, they're my coats.

        KRAMER: Look I want thirty-five percent.

        MORTY: I'm thinking more like fifteen.

        KRAMER: No way I'm taking fifteen.

        MORTY: Well you're not getting thirty-five.

        KRAMER: Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.

        MORTY: Ok it's a deal

        (They shack hands.)



        [Rudy's Antique Boutique]

        RUDY: Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth 
        to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're 
        everywhere. 

        GEORGE: I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money 
        back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.

        RUDY: (counting the money to make sure it's all there) It's already put 
        a dent in my fumigation bill.

        GEORGE: So uh where are the clothes? 

        RUDY: I burned 'em.

        GEORGE: Oh. That's good.



        [Monk's]

        (Jerry and Elaine sitting in the booth)

        ELAINE: N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. 
        But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going 
        to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? 
        I mean don't you find that abnormal?

        JERRY: It is a tad askew. 

        ELAINE: I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why 
        is this stranger doing it?

        JERRY: I've hardly been out to dinner with them.

        ELAINE: See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's 
        really doing is being nice but but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably 
        nice. 

        JERRY: You're right he's insane.

        ELAINE: Yes, he's insane, that's what I think. 

        JERRY: So what are you going to do?

        ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how 
        was the movie?

        JERRY: Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.

        ELAINE: Ya what do you mean from what you saw?

        JERRY: Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.

        ELAINE: Yea why not?

        JERRY: I was kind of um (pauses) making out.

        ELAINE: (thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's 
        List?

        JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just 
        got the better of me.

        ELAINE: During Schindler's List?

        JERRY: (trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents. 


        ELAINE: Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?

        JERRY: No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.

        ELAINE: Oh.



        [Jerry's Apartment]

        (A knock at the door prior to the reveal of Jerry's apartment; Morty is 
        sitting at the table Helen closes the refrigerator to answer the door; 
        Newman is revealed in his full Newman)

        NEWMAN: Hello Mrs. Seinfeld

        HELEN: (like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the 
        door on him)

        NEWMAN: Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice 
        trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his 
        pocket)

        HELEN: Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.

        NEWMAN: Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.

        HELEN: Wondering what?

        NEWMAN: Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.

        HELEN: Well we already saw it.

        NEWMAN: Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.

        MORTY: (getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?

        NEWMAN: Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what 
        I mean.

        HELEN: I'm afraid I don't.

        NEWMAN: Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty 
        good in the balcony.

        MORTY: What?

        NEWMAN: What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like 
        the storm-troopers into Poland.

        HELEN: Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?

        NEWMAN: Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just 
        really came up to get some detergent.

        HELEN: Jerry sends his laundry out.

        NEWMAN: (laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a 
        by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)

        (Helen closes the door and looks at Morty in disgust)



        [Jerry's Apartment-Later that day]

        (Jerry enters; Morty is sitting on the couch writing, Helen is in the 
        bathroom)

        JERRY: Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point 
        his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He 
        grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? 
        What did I do?

        HELEN: How could you?

        JERRY: How could I what?

        HELEN: You were making out during Schindler's List?

        JERRY: What? No.

        MORTY: Don't lie Jerry.

        JERRY: (turns) Newman. 

        HELEN: How could you do such a thing?

        JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time 
        and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and 
        the next thing we knew, the war was over.

        (Morty and Helen both sigh and turn to go back to what they were doing; 
        Phone rings)

        JERRY: (answering the phone) Hello.

        (Jack in Florida with a bandage on his right hand)

        JACK: Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.

        JERRY: Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.

        MORTY: Hello

        JACK: Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.

        MORTY: You didn't get in?

        JACK: Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got 
        my hand all cut up reaching in.

        MORTY: You broke the window?

        HELEN: He broke the window?

        JACK: You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?

        DORIS: (off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.

        MORTY: Did you send them?

        JACK: Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.

        MORTY: Tomorrow afternoon?

        HELEN: Tomorrow afternoon?

        JERRY: Tomorrow afternoon?

        MORTY: I told you to send them express.

        JACK: W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, 
        I figured what the hell's the difference.

        MORTY: So what did you do about the window?

        JACK: I gotta fix your window now?

        MORTY: All right all right. Goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs 
        up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.

        JERRY: W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?

        HELEN: We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't 
        the trip is off.

        MORTY: Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.

        (Jerry annoyed walks toward his room)

        HELEN: Some place else? What about Paris?

        MORTY: You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.

        HELEN: I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid 
        raincoats.

        MORTY: You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come 
        back.

        HELEN: I think you're out of your mind. 



        [Costanza House]

        FRANK: I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear. 

        GEORGE: Moths?

        FRANK: Moths, ate three boxes?

        GEORGE: Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.

        ESTELLE: You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds 
        anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's 
        Kramer.

        (Estelle goes to answer the door)

        KRAMER: (from outside) Hello?

        ESTELLE: Hello

        KRAMER: (still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses 
        Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)

        ESTELLE: Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)

        KRAMER: Ooo Paella

        GEORGE: Hey uh let me take you're coat.

        KRAMER: (giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.

        FRANK: That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?

        KRAMER: Wha?


        FRANK: That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! 
        (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal 
        my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back

        KRAMER: (trying to get away) woah 

        GEORGE: Dad?!

        KRAMER: (laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it 
        from Rudy.

        GEORGE: Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.

        FRANK: Who's Rudy? What clothes?

        GEORGE: I sold your clothes yesterday.

        FRANK: You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you 
        mean you sold my clothes?

        GEORGE: I didn't think you wore them anymore.

        FRANK: It's cruise wear!

        ESTELLE: Kramer, I love that shirt. 

        KRAMER: Yaya

        FRANK: THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!!

        ESTELLE: You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon. 

        KRAMER: Oh, well, thank you.

        (Estelle giggles)

        FRANK: Who's this Rudy?

        KRAMER: Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.

        FRANK: Mory Seinfeld? He's a bum.

        KRAMER: Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his 
        plane for it.

        GEORGE: Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?

        KRAMER: Yea.

        GEORGE: What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?

        KRAMER: Well I suppose they are wasted.

        GEORGE: Yes I suppose they are.

        FRANK: Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.

        KRAMER: A mouse!

        (Frank starts making noises; Kramer and Frank both run to the other room 
        where they get stuff in between the door and wall; Frank hits Kramer to 
        get him in then closes the door)



        [Monk's]

        (Jerry and George enter)

        JERRY: You want the tickets?

        GEORGE: Yes.

        JERRY: You're gonna take this kid to Paris?

        GEORGE: Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, 
        I mail my own postcards.

        JERRY: You know I'm paying for these tickets.

        GEORGE: It's alright, I got lunch.



        [Airport]

        (Kramer, Morty and Jerry standing at a luggage carousel)

        KRAMER: Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the 
        Payaya was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?

        MORTY: Not really.

        KRAMER: Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, 
        the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm

        JERRY: Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?

        MORTY: This is it.

        KRAMER: So how much are we gonna make?

        MORTY: Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.

        KRAMER: Wha two thousand? Three thousand?

        MORTY: That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item. 

        KRAMER: More? More than three thousand?

        MORTY: Just watch me do my thing.

        JERRY: Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to 
        an open box) isn't that one of yours? 

        MORTY: Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape 
        it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around 
        grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you 
        missed a couple.

        WOMAN: Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.

        JERRY: (turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your 
        charter group?

        (George and Joey enter the scene getting in line for the Charter Flight)

        GEORGE: Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. 
        The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror 
        before you go to sleep at night.

        JOEY: Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying 
        with us in Paris.

        (Joey walks by George to board the plane and puts his Gum on the wall.)



        [Rudy's Antique Boutique]

        FRANK: You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.

        RUDY: Who are you anyways?

        FRANK: I'm the father.

        RUDY: He said his father was dead.

        FRANK: He said I was dead?

        RUDY: That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.

        FRANK: That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.

        (Kramer and Morty enter with a bunch of raincoats)

        KRAMER: Hey, Frank!

        FRANK: Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.

        MORTY: Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.

        FRANK: I'm retracting that it was ever offered.

        MORTY: I retract your retraction.

        FRANK: Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?

        MORTY: Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.

        RUDY: You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.

        KRAMER: I thought we had a deal?

        FRANK: That's another one of my shirts!!

        RUDY: I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.

        MORTY: Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five 
        years.

        RUDY: Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?

        FRANK: My clothes don't have moths!

        MORTY: Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?

        RUDY: That's right.

        KRAMER: (laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they 
        all look at it)

        now boarding.

        MORTY: Ok, let's go.

        HELEN: (to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see 
        us off.

        AARON: Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?

        ELAINE & JERRY: NO.

        MORTY: Ah, good-bye.

        (Jerry hugs Morty; Helen and Elaine give each other a kiss)

        MORTY: Buh bye Elaine

        JERRY: Buh bye.

        HELEN: Buh bye.

        (Aaron torn by emotion moves in and gives Morty and Helen a hug a hug)

        HELEN: (looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call 
        you when we get home.

        AARON: Thank you.

        JERRY: I think she meant me, but.

        MORTY: Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.

        JERRY: Ok.

        (Morty and Helen go to board the plane)

        ELAINE: Bye.

        JERRY: Bye.

        (Aaron begins to follow them)

        ELAINE: Aaron? Aaron are you ok?

        AARON: I could've done more. I could've done so much more.

        ELAINE: You did enough.

        AARON: (turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got 
        them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.

        JERRY: You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.

        AARON: (holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their 
        whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more 
        dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other 
        like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to 
        the Flight Agent)

        ELAINE: Why?

        AARON: (to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get 
        the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!

        (Jerry and Elaine continue to look at him funny)



        [Rachel's Parents' Place]

        (Jerry knocks on the door; Mr. Goldstein answers)

        JERRY: Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?

        MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, 
        or any other night for that matter. 

        JERRY: Why what did I do?

        MR. GOLDSTEIN: (Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. 
        I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. 
        You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter 
        to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman 
        happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I 
        believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') 
        Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door)

        JERRY: Rachel! 

        MR. GOLDSTEIN: (closing the door on Jerry) Good night!

        JERRY: Rachel!



        [Monk's]

        (Jerry and Elaine at the normal booth)

        JERRY: So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the 
        light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.

        ELAINE: Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did 
        it happen?

        JERRY: The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right 
        in.

        ELAINE: Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.

        JERRY: Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something 
        else up for them.

        ELAINE: (sighs) So how about that Aaron? 

        JERRY: Whew

        ELAINE: You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that 
        he stood too close to you when he talked?

        JERRY: No I hadn't noticed.

        (Newman enters and walks by the table; Jerry doesn't notice him as he 
        is getting something out of his coat pocket)

        NEWMAN: (at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.

        JERRY: (hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.

        NEWMAN: (moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello 
        Jerry.

        JERRY: Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the 
        other night.

        NEWMAN: Ohh, were you there?

        JERRY: Yes I was.

        NEWMAN: (looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.

        JERRY: Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?

        NEWMAN: (couple quick breaths) Shocking.

        JERRY: Yes, well that was nothing.

        (Newman makes a noise and takes off toward the door as Jerry gets up)

        NEWMAN: (running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!

        (Jerry chases Newman right out the door)

        (George is sitting at an outside eatery in France with Joey)

        GEORGE: Where the hell is your father?!

        some stuff on George's glasses)

        (Estelle and Frank walking around on the boat)

        ESTELLE: This is the best thing we ever did.

        FRANK: I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.

        ESTELLE: Ah forget about them let's just...

        (Frank and Estelle run into Morty and Helen)


        [Rudy's Antique Boutique]

        (Rudy is checking out the clothes)

        GEORGE: I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't 
        accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)

        RUDY: Uh huh.

        GEORGE: They will get a good home won't they?

        RUDY: Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.

        GEORGE: Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, 
        he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really.

        RUDY: I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.

        GEORGE: Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.

        RUDY: Yea I'm in a good mood here.

        GEORGE: Thank you.

        (Kramer enters)

        KRAMER: Hey, George what are you doing here?

        GEORGE: Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's 
        eyes) that's what he would have wanted.

        KRAMER: Oh, I gotcha (clicks)

        GEORGE: (leaving) That'll do.

        KRAMER: Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business 
        together, selling raincoats.

        GEORGE: Hey that's swell.

        KRAMER: Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.

        GEORGE: Dinner? (grabs Kramer)

        KRAMER: Ya.

        GEORGE: You had dinner with the Seinfelds?

        KRAMER: Yea, last night.

        GEORGE: Was this something you had planned for a while?

        KRAMER: No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly 
        by the seat of his vintage pants.

        GEORGE: (hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!

        KRAMER: Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes 
        George just sold Rudy)

        RUDY: Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. 
        Two for twenty-five dollars.

        KRAMER: Oh I'll take these.

        RUDY: All right

        KRAMER: Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?

        RUDY: Sure that's the Executive. 

        KRAMER: Ya, you have any others?

        RUDY: I wish. They don't make 'em anymore.

        KRAMER: Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be 
        interested?

        RUDY: Very interested

        KRAMER: Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.

        RUDY: Well bring 'em in.

        KRAMER: So you'll buy them?

        RUDY: I don't see what would possibly stop me.

        (Out of one of the boxes George sold Rudy flies a couple of moths as the 
        scene ends)



        [Jerry's Apartment]

        (George enters)

        GEORGE: Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They 
        had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little 
        dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans! 

        JERRY: What are you talking about?


        GEORGE: Mom and Pop Seinfeld

        JERRY: Look I don't know.

        GEORGE: All right I happen to know what they did last night, they had 
        dinner with Kramer.

        JERRY: Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.

        GEORGE: So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents? 
        

        JERRY: That's right.

        GEORGE: Is there something wrong with my parents?

        JERRY: Absolutely

        GEORGE: Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.

        JERRY: These the people you currently live with?

        GEORGE: Yes.

        JERRY: Uh huh

        GEORGE: So are they coming tonight or not?

        JERRY: Look I really don't know what they're plans are.

        GEORGE: Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting 
        if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.

        JERRY: What is that anyway?

        GEORGE: It's a Spanish dish. It's a mlange of fish, an meat with rice. 
        Very tasty.

        JERRY: I-I'll tell 'em

        GEORGE: Hey could you do one other thing for me?

        JERRY: Name it.

        GEORGE: You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little 
        kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that 
        the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry 
        smiles) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as 
        long as they're going (claps)

        JERRY: So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't 
        be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, 
        through the streets of Paris?

        GEORGE: (pause) All right if you think it's too much they don't have to 
        mail the postcards.

        (Enter Morty)

        MORTY: Hello Elaine

        (Morty gives Elaine a kiss; Elaine is in shock)

        AARON: I was able to finagle two more tickets to "My Fair Lady" 
        and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen.

        ELAINE: Oh, Great.

        MORTY: (looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?

        (song from "My Fair Lady") "I could have danced all night, 
        I could have danced all night, and still have begged for more. I could

        GEORGE: Yea

        FRANK: It's a slap in the face.

        ESTELLE: (with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George 
        puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down 
        as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!

        FRANK: What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy 
        and sell 'em like that.

        (Frank leaves the kitchen and moves into the living room)

        ESTELLE: The hell with them.

        GEORGE: (in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The 
        thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.

        shuts the door)

        know to take your mind off of what it really is 'nasty wear.' Oh it's 
        clean you know people wear underwear, ya well they don't wear iron underwear 
        and that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes. I mean I'll 
        move into an apartment after a strange person moves out, why would I wanna 
        move into somebody's pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but 
        it's not because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men 
        wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang on to 
        underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained 
        it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear 
        vapor. W-we don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes 
        out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just 
        go (blows on the mic) and it's gone that it is jus.



        [Movie Theater: Schindler's List]

        (Schindler's List is playing as Jerry and Rachel are making out. Newman 
        is then seen disgusted by this display)



        [Jerry's Apartment]

        (Jerry Enters; Morty and Helen are sitting at the table with a map out)

        JERRY: Hey.

        MORTY: Hey, Jerry.

        HELEN: So how was the movie?

        JERRY: Oh, really good, really good.

        HELEN: And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)


        JERRY: Like that (snaps his fingers)

        MORTY: What about the end, with the list?

        JERRY: Ya that was some list.

        HELEN: What did you think about the black and white?

        JERRY: (confused) The black and white.

        MORTY: The whole movie was in black and white.

        JERRY: Oh yea, I didn't even realize. 

        MORTY: You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.

        JERRY: Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.



        [Rudy's Antique Boutique]

        KRAMER: So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All 
        you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there 
        (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle

        RUDY: Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the 
        coats come in.

        KRAMER; Ya hey I'm on your side.

        (George enters)

        KRAMER: Hey what again?

        GEORGE: I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) 
        Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra 
        Paella. 

        KRAMER: Payaya, ya I'll be there.

        GEORGE: Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say 
        anything bad about your uh your partner.

        KRAMER: No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.

        GEORGE: Twenty-five percent? It was your idea. 

        KRAMER: Yap I know.

        GEORGE: You're doing all the leg work.

        KRAMER: That's right

        GEORGE: He's ripping you off

        KRAMER: You're right he's ripping me off

        GEORGE: If anybody should be getting more it's you.

        KRAMER: He's ripping me off

        GEORGE: Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.

        KRAMER: YAH! (exits)

        RUDY: (coming out of the back-room noticing George) Oh it's you? You're 
        the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.



        [Jerry's Apartment]

        (Morty coming out of the bathroom)

        MORTY: You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five 
        percent?

        HELEN: Well he told you about the place.

        MORTY: So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders 
        fee. You know what a finders fee is? 

        HELEN: You find something you get a fee.

        MORTY: Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.

        HELEN: Well it's too late now.

        MORTY: Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting 
        years for this pay off.

        HELEN: Well you're not gonna say anything.

        (Kramer enters)

        KRAMER: I've been thinking about something.

        MORTY: Ya so have I

        KRAMER: Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.

        MORTY: You don't think it's fair.

        KRAMER: No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing 
        all the leg work.

        MORTY: What leg work?

        KRAMER: Oh, there's leg work.

        MORTY: If anything you're getting too much.

        KRAMER: Too much?!

        MORTY: That's right, they're my coats.

        KRAMER: Look I want thirty-five percent.

        MORTY: I'm thinking more like fifteen.

        KRAMER: No way I'm taking fifteen.

        MORTY: Well you're not getting thirty-five.

        KRAMER: Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.

        MORTY: Ok it's a deal

        (They shack hands.)



        [Rudy's Antique Boutique]

        RUDY: Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth 
        to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're 
        everywhere. 

        GEORGE: I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money 
        back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.

        RUDY: (counting the money to make sure it's all there) It's already put 
        a dent in my fumigation bill.

        GEORGE: So uh where are the clothes? 

        RUDY: I burned 'em.

        GEORGE: Oh. That's good.



        [Monk's]

        (Jerry and Elaine sitting in the booth)

        ELAINE: N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. 
        But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going 
        to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? 
        I mean don't you find that abnormal?

        JERRY: It is a tad askew. 

        ELAINE: I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why 
        is this stranger doing it?

        JERRY: I've hardly been out to dinner with them.

        ELAINE: See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's 
        really doing is being nice but but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably 
        nice. 

        JERRY: You're right he's insane.

        ELAINE: Yes, he's insane, that's what I think. 

        JERRY: So what are you going to do?

        ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how 
        was the movie?

        JERRY: Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.

        ELAINE: Ya what do you mean from what you saw?

        JERRY: Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.

        ELAINE: Yea why not?

        JERRY: I was kind of um (pauses) making out.

        ELAINE: (thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's 
        List?

        JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just 
        got the better of me.

        ELAINE: During Schindler's List?


        JERRY: (trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents. 

        ELAINE: Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?

        JERRY: No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.

        ELAINE: Oh.



        [Jerry's Apartment]

        (A knock at the door prior to the reveal of Jerry's apartment; Morty is 
        sitting at the table Helen closes the refrigerator to answer the door; 
        Newman is revealed in his full Newman)

        NEWMAN: Hello Mrs. Seinfeld

        HELEN: (like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the 
        door on him)

        NEWMAN: Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice 
        trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his 
        pocket)

        HELEN: Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.

        NEWMAN: Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.

        HELEN: Wondering what?

        NEWMAN: Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.

        HELEN: Well we already saw it.

        NEWMAN: Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.

        MORTY: (getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?

        NEWMAN: Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what 
        I mean.

        HELEN: I'm afraid I don't.

        NEWMAN: Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty 
        good in the balcony.

        MORTY: What?

        NEWMAN: What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like 
        the storm-troopers into Poland.

        HELEN: Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?

        NEWMAN: Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just 
        really came up to get some detergent.

        HELEN: Jerry sends his laundry out.

        NEWMAN: (laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a 
        by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)

        (Helen closes the door and looks at Morty in disgust)



        [Jerry's Apartment-Later that day]

        (Jerry enters; Morty is sitting on the couch writing, Helen is in the 
        bathroom)

        JERRY: Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point 
        his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He 
        grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? 
        What did I do?

        HELEN: How could you?

        JERRY: How could I what?

        HELEN: You were making out during Schindler's List?

        JERRY: What? No.

        MORTY: Don't lie Jerry.

        JERRY: (turns) Newman. 

        HELEN: How could you do such a thing?

        JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time 
        and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and 
        the next thing we knew, the war was over.

        (Morty and Helen both sigh and turn to go back to what they were doing; 
        Phone rings)

        JERRY: (answering the phone) Hello.

        (Jack in Florida with a bandage on his right hand)

        JACK: Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.

        JERRY: Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.

        MORTY: Hello

        JACK: Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.

        MORTY: You didn't get in?

        JACK: Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got 
        my hand all cut up reaching in.

        MORTY: You broke the window?

        HELEN: He broke the window?

        JACK: You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?

        DORIS: (off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.

        MORTY: Did you send them?

        JACK: Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.

        MORTY: Tomorrow afternoon?

        HELEN: Tomorrow afternoon?

        JERRY: Tomorrow afternoon?

        MORTY: I told you to send them express.

        JACK: W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, 
        I figured what the hell's the difference.

        MORTY: So what did you do about the window?

        JACK: I gotta fix your window now?

        MORTY: All right all right. Goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs 
        up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.

        JERRY: W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?

        HELEN: We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't 
        the trip is off.

        MORTY: Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.

        (Jerry annoyed walks toward his room)

        HELEN: Some place else? What about Paris?

        MORTY: You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.

        HELEN: I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid 
        raincoats.

        MORTY: You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come 
        back.

        HELEN: I think you're out of your mind. 



        [Costanza House]

        FRANK: I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear. 

        GEORGE: Moths?

        FRANK: Moths, ate three boxes?

        GEORGE: Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.

        ESTELLE: You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds 
        anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's 
        Kramer.

        (Estelle goes to answer the door)

        KRAMER: (from outside) Hello?

        ESTELLE: Hello

        KRAMER: (still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses 
        Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)

        ESTELLE: Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)

        KRAMER: Ooo Paella

        GEORGE: Hey uh let me take you're coat.

        KRAMER: (giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.

        FRANK: That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?


        KRAMER: Wha?

        FRANK: That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! 
        (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal 
        my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back

        KRAMER: (trying to get away) woah 

        GEORGE: Dad?!

        KRAMER: (laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it 
        from Rudy.

        GEORGE: Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.

        FRANK: Who's Rudy? What clothes?

        GEORGE: I sold your clothes yesterday.

        FRANK: You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you 
        mean you sold my clothes?

        GEORGE: I didn't think you wore them anymore.

        FRANK: It's cruise wear!

        ESTELLE: Kramer, I love that shirt. 

        KRAMER: Yaya

        FRANK: THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!!

        ESTELLE: You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon. 

        KRAMER: Oh, well, thank you.

        (Estelle giggles)

        FRANK: Who's this Rudy?

        KRAMER: Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.

        FRANK: Mory Seinfeld? He's a bum.

        KRAMER: Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his 
        plane for it.

        GEORGE: Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?

        KRAMER: Yea.

        GEORGE: What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?

        KRAMER: Well I suppose they are wasted.

        GEORGE: Yes I suppose they are.

        FRANK: Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.

        KRAMER: A mouse!

        (Frank starts making noises; Kramer and Frank both run to the other room 
        where they get stuff in between the door and wall; Frank hits Kramer to 
        get him in then closes the door)



        [Monk's]

        (Jerry and George enter)

        JERRY: You want the tickets?

        GEORGE: Yes.

        JERRY: You're gonna take this kid to Paris?

        GEORGE: Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, 
        I mail my own postcards.

        JERRY: You know I'm paying for these tickets.

        GEORGE: It's alright, I got lunch.



        [Airport]

        (Kramer, Morty and Jerry standing at a luggage carousel)

        KRAMER: Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the 
        Payaya was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?

        MORTY: Not really.

        KRAMER: Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, 
        the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm

        JERRY: Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?

        MORTY: This is it.

        KRAMER: So how much are we gonna make?

        MORTY: Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.

        KRAMER: Wha two thousand? Three thousand?

        MORTY: That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item. 

        KRAMER: More? More than three thousand?

        MORTY: Just watch me do my thing.

        JERRY: Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to 
        an open box) isn't that one of yours? 

        MORTY: Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape 
        it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around 
        grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you 
        missed a couple.

        WOMAN: Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.

        JERRY: (turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your 
        charter group?

        (George and Joey enter the scene getting in line for the Charter Flight)

        GEORGE: Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. 
        The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror 
        before you go to sleep at night.

        JOEY: Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying 
        with us in Paris.

        (Joey walks by George to board the plane and puts his Gum on the wall.)



        [Rudy's Antique Boutique]

        FRANK: You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.

        RUDY: Who are you anyways?

        FRANK: I'm the father.

        RUDY: He said his father was dead.

        FRANK: He said I was dead?

        RUDY: That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.

        FRANK: That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.

        (Kramer and Morty enter with a bunch of raincoats)

        KRAMER: Hey, Frank!

        FRANK: Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.

        MORTY: Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.

        FRANK: I'm retracting that it was ever offered.

        MORTY: I retract your retraction.

        FRANK: Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?

        MORTY: Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.

        RUDY: You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.

        KRAMER: I thought we had a deal?

        FRANK: That's another one of my shirts!!

        RUDY: I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.

        MORTY: Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five 
        years.

        RUDY: Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?

        FRANK: My clothes don't have moths!

        MORTY: Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?

        RUDY: That's right.

        KRAMER: (laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they 
        all look at it)



        [Airport]

        (Morty and Helen with a couple bags; Jerry, Elaine and Aaron saying good-bye)


        ANNOUNCEMENT: Flight-433 now boarding for Miami, Gate 18a. Flight-433 
        now boarding.

        MORTY: Ok, let's go.

        HELEN: (to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see 
        us off.

        AARON: Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?

        ELAINE & JERRY: NO.

        MORTY: Ah, good-bye.

        (Jerry hugs Morty; Helen and Elaine give each other a kiss)

        ELAINE: Good-bye

        JERRY: Take care

        MORTY: Alright Jer.

        (Morty and Elaine hug; Jerry and Helen give each other a kiss)

        ELAINE: Nice to see..

        MORTY: Buh bye Elaine

        JERRY: Buh bye.

        HELEN: Buh bye.

        (Aaron torn by emotion moves in and gives Morty and Helen a hug a hug)

        HELEN: (looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call 
        you when we get home.

        AARON: Thank you.

        JERRY: I think she meant me, but.

        MORTY: Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.

        JERRY: Ok.

        (Morty and Helen go to board the plane)

        ELAINE: Bye.

        JERRY: Bye.

        (Aaron begins to follow them)

        ELAINE: Aaron? Aaron are you ok?

        AARON: I could've done more. I could've done so much more.

        ELAINE: You did enough.

        AARON: (turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got 
        them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.

        JERRY: You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.

        AARON: (holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their 
        whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more 
        dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other 
        like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to 
        the Flight Agent)

        ELAINE: Why?

        AARON: (to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get 
        the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!

        (Jerry and Elaine continue to look at him funny)



        [Rachel's Parents' Place]

        (Jerry knocks on the door; Mr. Goldstein answers)

        JERRY: Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?

        MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, 
        or any other night for that matter. 

        JERRY: Why what did I do?

        MR. GOLDSTEIN: (Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. 
        I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. 
        You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter 
        to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman 
        happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I 
        believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') 
        Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door)

        JERRY: Rachel! 

        MR. GOLDSTEIN: (closing the door on Jerry) Good night!

        JERRY: Rachel!



        [Monk's]

        (Jerry and Elaine at the normal booth)

        JERRY: So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the 
        light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.

        ELAINE: Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did 
        it happen?

        JERRY: The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right 
        in.

        ELAINE: Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.

        JERRY: Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something 
        else up for them.

        ELAINE: (sighs) So how about that Aaron? 

        JERRY: Whew

        ELAINE: You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that 
        he stood too close to you when he talked?

        JERRY: No I hadn't noticed.

        (Newman enters and walks by the table; Jerry doesn't notice him as he 
        is getting something out of his coat pocket)

        NEWMAN: (at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.

        JERRY: (hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.

        NEWMAN: (moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello 
        Jerry.

        JERRY: Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the 
        other night.

        NEWMAN: Ohh, were you there?

        JERRY: Yes I was.

        NEWMAN: (looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.

        JERRY: Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?

        NEWMAN: (couple quick breaths) Shocking.

        JERRY: Yes, well that was nothing.

        (Newman makes a noise and takes off toward the door as Jerry gets up)

        NEWMAN: (running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!

        (Jerry chases Newman right out the door)

        (George is sitting at an outside eatery in France with Joey)

        GEORGE: Where the hell is your father?!

        some stuff on George's glasses)

        [Cruise ship out in the Ocean]

        (Estelle and Frank walking around on the boat)

        ESTELLE: This is the best thing we ever did.

        FRANK: I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.

        ESTELLE: Ah forget about them let's just...

        (Frank and Estelle run into Morty and Helen)


        Opening monologue.

        There's something very insincere about these greeting cards we send back 
        and
        forth to each other all the time. They're like these little one-dollar 
        folded
        paper emotional prostitutes, isn't it? "I don't know what my feelings 
        are, so
        I'll just pay some total stranger a buck to make up this little Hallmark 
        hooker
        to do the job for me. So I can go, 'Yeah, I didn't write this, but whatever
        they wrote, I think the same thing.'" Wouldn't it be better if we 
        just had one
        card that covered every occasion for everybody in one shot? Just "Happy
        birthday, merry Christmas, happy anniversary, congratulations, it's a 
        Boy and
        our deepest sympathies. Signed, the whole office"


        First scene.
        Elaine and Jerry and in Jerry's apartment.

        Elaine: She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?

        Jerry: Your friend, Noreen.

        Elaine: Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?

        Jerry: If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a 
        little
        less annoying than Noreen.

        Elaine: I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.

        Jerry: If you don't believe me, ask her.

        Elaine: I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. 
        
        Remember, we went to that party at his house?

        Jerry: Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.

        Elaine: Yeah.

        Kramer enters.

        Kramer: Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?

        Jerry: Check the pile.

        Kramer (leafing through Jerry's mail): Oh, who sent you a card?

        Jerry: I don't know.

        Kramer: Open it, it's from Hallmark.

        Jerry: Oh.  
        

        Kramer (To Elaine): Hello, my love.

        Elaine: Hello, darling.

        Jerry: Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.

        Kramer: Let me see.

        Elaine: Who's Kristin?

        Jerry: She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.

        Kramer: Did you ask her about me?

        Jerry: Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that 
        sits
        in the back and answers the phone.

        Kramer: Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get 
        a
        percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?

        Jerry: No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money 
        goes
        to the station.

        Kramer: Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote 
        bag
        though, right?

        Jerry: Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.

        Kramer leaves, satisfied.

        Elaine (dialing the phone): You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.

        Jerry: Oh, go ahead.

        Elaine: You sure you don't mind?

        Jerry: Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.

        Elaine finishes dialing, the phone rings and a high pitched voice answers.

        High Pitched Voice: Hello?

        Elaine: Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.

        High Pitched Voice: Jerry?

        Elaine: Jerry Seinfeld.

        High Pitched Voice: Oh, I like Jerry a lot.

        Elaine: You mean like like?

        High Pitched Voice: What are you talking about?

        Elaine: Noreen, were you hitting on him?

        Cut to the other end of the conversation, there's a bald man on the telephone.

        High Pitched Voice: Noreen's not here, this is Dan.

        Elaine: Ooh.

        Dan: You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?

        Elaine (hanging up): Uh, I'll call you back later.

        Elaine: Uh oh.

        Jerry: So was I right? She likes me, right?


        New scene.
        Elaine is sharpening pencils for Mr. Pitt. The phone is ringing.


        Mr. Pitt (answering): Hello? (to Elaine) It's for you. Must you keep giving
        my number out?

        Elaine: Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?

        High Pitched Voice: Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was
        hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?

        Elaine: Is this Noreen?

        High Pitched Voice (Noreen): What would ever possess you to make up a 
        story
        like that.

        Elaine: Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--

        Dan (taking the phone from Noreen): I think I deserve an explanation.

        Elaine: Noreen, are you crying?

        Dan: No, this is Dan!

        Elaine: Oh, hi Dan.

        Mr. Pitt: Elaine? Work?

        Elaine: Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.

        Mr. Pitt: Who was crying?

        Elaine: No one. I'm sorry Mr. Putt, that won't happen again.

        Mr. Pitt (unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it 
        with
        knife and fork): I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want 
        to know
        who it was.

        Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other 
        friend
        Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife 
        and
        fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called 
        her to
        see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is 
        this,
        you know--


        New scene.
        Jerry and Kristin, the PBS rep, are in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is reading 
        from
        a sheet of paper.

        Jerry: I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking
        about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge 
        now.

        Kristin: Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.

        Jerry: Oh, I know you are.

        Kristin: You got the card I sent?

        Jerry: I did.

        Kristin: So where is it?

        Jerry: What? 

        Kristin: The card. Is this it in the trash?

        Jerry: No?

        Kristin: This is my card, you threw it away.

        Jerry: Well--

        Kristin: I put a lot of thought into this card.

        Jerry: You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like 
        you
        painted the picture and wrote the poem.

        Kristin: Fine. I gotta get back to the office.

        Jerry: Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save 
        it?

        Kristin: You have no sentimentality.

        Jerry: I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's
        some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, 
        I'm
        not a bad guy.

        Kristin: Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great!

        Jerry (as Kristin is storming out): Well, but, you see, I saved something! 
        
        See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?

        Kramer enters as Kristin leaves.

        Kramer: New cards, huh?

        Jerry: No, they're old cards from my grandmother.

        Kramer: Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift 
        a
        person's spirits.

        Jerry: Yeah.

        Kramer (opening a card): Oh, a check.

        Jerry: Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's 
        why I
        save them.

        Kramer: There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?

        Jerry: I don't know, it's ten dollars.

        Kramer: But you got a whole pile here. 1987?

        Jerry: Oh so what.

        Kramer: Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend 
        the
        money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to 
        a slap in
        the face.

        Jerry: Oh, get out of here.

        Kramer: Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.

        Jerry: Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.

        Kramer: Yeah.


        New scene.
        Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

        Jerry: It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS 
        drive. 
        I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?

        George: The rule is a minimum of two days.

        Jerry: You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?

        George: I'm making it up.

        Jerry: I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I 
        had a
        mantel.

        George: Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.

        Jerry: Absolutely.

        George: If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different 
        person.

        Jerry: So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me 
        a favor.

        George: Let's have it.

        Jerry: Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna 
        be
        running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball
        player to come on the show with me...

        George: You want me to ask one of the Yankees.

        Jerry: Could you?

        George: Alright. I'll run it by a few people.

        Jerry: Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.

        Elaine (entering and sitting down): I should never have made that phone 
        call.

        Jerry: Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?

        Elaine: Yes, she's very upset.

        Jerry: So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?

        Elaine: I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--

        George: Who was flirting with you?

        Jerry: Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?


        George: She wasn't flirting with you.

        Jerry: Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? 
        Come
        on.

        Elaine: Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.

        Elaine and George laugh derisively.

        Jerry: Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?

        Elaine: So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. 
        Pitt
        eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.

        George: Really?

        Elaine: Yeah.

        Jerry: Why does he do that?

        George: He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's 
        the
        way these society types eat their candy bars.

        Jerry: Oh, you know.

        George: What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse 
        me,
        sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?

        Waitress: That's the extra toast. Get it?

        George: Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened
        here?

        Elaine: What?

        George: Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the 
        finger.

        Jerry: That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to 
        get
        their mouths dirty.


        New scene.
        George is in a meeting at work.

        George: So, what do you think?

        Mr. Morgan: A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' 
        time
        with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel 
        eleven.

        George: Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, 
        for
        trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might 
        not watch
        channel eleven.

        George begins eating a candy bar with knife and fork.

        Mr. Morgan: Uh, what the hell are you doing?

        George: I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?

        Mr. Morgan: You know, maybe George has something here about PBS.

        Oh dear. I'll be down there first thing in the morning.

        Voice (unheard by Nana as she hangs up the phone): Wait, we can do this 
        over the
        phone.

        Fade to the next morning, the alarm clock goes off, it's 5:30, Nana turns

        George: Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.

        Jerry: Excuse me?

        George: Jerry, I'm Yankee management.

        Kramer: Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.

        Jerry: You're just answering phones!

        Kramer: It would put me at ease.

        George: Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the 
        menu. I
        want to see what finger she uses.

        Jerry: Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on 
        the men

        Waitress: Oh, you're getting it (pointing to menu with index finger), 
        it comes
        with your breakfast special.

        Jerry: Right you are.

        George: I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.

        Waitress (scratching cheek with middle finger): I'll check.

        George (after waitress walks away): I don't believe it, she did it again!

        Jerry: Oh, she had an itch.

        George: She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. 
        That
        finger was meant for me.

        Kramer (laughing): Yeah, she knew what she was doing.

        Street tough: The bank? It burned. It's gone!

        Street tough: Now what you wanna do is go down to forty-ninth street,

        Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.

        Kramer enters.

        Jerry: Nana's missing?

        Uncle Leo: I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't 
        here. 
        I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment
        in twenty-five years!

        Jerry: I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.

        Kramer: Yeah, that's right. You did.


        Uncle Leo: What kind of checks?

        Jerry: I think Chemical Bank.

        Kramer: Oh, they were Chemical.

        Uncle Leo: Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. 
        
        What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?

        Jerry: Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never
        should have cashed those checks!

        Kramer: Hey, I didn't twist your arm.

        Uncle Leo: Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?

        Jerry: Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) 
        Well? 
        I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!

        Kramer: Well, don't look at me.

        Jerry: It's your fault!

        Kramer: My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those 
        bum
        checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.

        Noreen: So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested 
        in
        Jerry, he won't let up.

        Elaine: I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like 
        that.

        Noreen: No, why?

        Elaine: Well, you know, because he's a high talker.

        Noreen: He does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal.

        Elaine: No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.

        Noreen: Really?

        Elaine: You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?

        Noreen: I never noticed that.

        Elaine: Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound 
        like a
        woman, you know?

        Noreen: Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.

        Elaine: Well, he looks like a man.

        Noreen: Yeah.

        Elaine: He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.

        Noreen: I guess.

        Elaine: I know he belches a lot.

        Noreen: Well, that's something. So, Jerry thought I was flirting with 
        him.

        Elaine: Yeah.

        Noreen (cutting into a cookie with a knife and fork): Hm. He's kind of 
        a
        baritone, isn't he?

        Elaine: What are you doing?

        Noreen: I'm eating this cookie.

        Elaine: No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you 
        just
        think of that?

        Noreen: No, I've seen people do it. I like it.

        Danny Tartabull: This isn't gonna take long, is it?

        George: Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to 
        know I
        perused the script and it's met with my approval.

        Danny Tartabull: I'm sure it's fine.

        George (swerving): Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me 
        the
        finger!

        Danny Tartabull: You sure?

        George: Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!

        Jerry: Would you?

        Elaine (answering): Hello?

        Nana: Hello, I need to speak to Jerry.

        Elaine (thinking it's Dan): Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you. 
        
        Listen, Jerry doesn't want to talk to you. Nobody wants to talk to you, 
        so why
        don't you just drop dead? 

        Elaine (hanging up): Heh?

        Kramer enters.

        Kramer: Any word from Nana?

        Jerry: No.

        Elaine: Nana?

        Jerry: Yeah, my grandma's missing.

        Elaine: Missing?

        Jerry: Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.

        Elaine: Um, what does Nana sound like?

        Jerry: Like a grandmother, why?

        Elaine: Well...

        Jerry: Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!

        Elaine: I don't know, maybe.

        Jerry: You told Nana to drop dead?!

        Elaine: It's possible.

        Jerry: Yes, it is!

        tote bags and tote bags I shall have.

        Kristin: Jerry, this man wants to see you.

        Jerry: Leo?

        Uncle Leo: Hello.

        Jerry: Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?

        Uncle Leo: I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.

        Jerry: Oh.

        Uncle Leo: She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on 
        the TV.

        Kristin: Jerry, I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull. Where is he?

        Jerry: He'll be here any second.

        Kristin: You know you guys are both on in five minutes.

        Jerry: Yeah, yeah.

        Kristin (leaving): Okay.

        Uncle Leo: Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody
        asks you where you got it, you don't know.

        Jerry: No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.

        Uncle Leo: What are you talking about? 

        Jerry: Please-

        Uncle Leo: I want-

        Jerry: It's not necessary.

        Uncle Leo: Jerry, would you please take it.

        Jerry: I can't, I can't take it.

        Uncle Leo: I want you to have it!

        Jerry: Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!

        Uncle Leo: Jerry, take the money!

        Jerry: I don't want it!!

        There's a knock at the door.

        High pitched voice: Jerry, open up. We need to talk.

        Kramer: Who's that?

        Jerry: You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting
        on me in the book store.

        Kramer: Jerry, I'll take care of it.

        Kramer walks out and sees Dan.

        Dan: Is Jerry in there?

        Kramer: Well, he can't be disturbed now.

        Dan: Well this situation is driving me crazy. He's all I think about. 
        I can't
        get him out of my mind.

        Kramer: I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you 
        up
        in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.

        Dan: What?

        Kramer: Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many
        programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City,
        Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those 
        dark
        ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted 
        because of
        your, you know.

        Dan: No, I don't.

        Kristin (running up): Are you Danny Tartabull?

        Dan: No, I'm not.


        New scene.
        George is parked at a gas station, he steps out of the car and slams the 
        door.

        George: I'll take care of this, Danny.

        George approaches the man he's been following, who's now pumping gas.

        George: Excuse me.

        Man: What's the problem?

        George: I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.

        Man: I did? Where?

        George: Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.

        Man: Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?

        George: That's right, of the New York Yankees.

        Man: I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.

        The man holds up his arm, it's in a cast with his middle finger sticking
        straight up.


        New scene.
        Jerry is doing his bit for PBS.

        Jerry: I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking
        about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please 
        call the
        number you see on your screen.

        Cut to Nana, watching the pledge drive. She picks up the phone and dials.

        Cut back to Jerry,

        Jerry: This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. 
        You've
        been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-

        Cut to Kramer sitting at the phone bank, his phone rings.

        Kramer (answering): PBS pledge drive.

        Nana: Hello, I'd like to speak with Jerry.

        Kramer: Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna
        happen.

        Nana: This is his grandmother.

        Kramer: Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.

        Nana: Tell Jerry I'm sorry, I'm going to have to write him some new checks.

        Kramer: As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a 
        little
        over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a
        freeloader.


        Cut back to Jerry.

        Jerry: -programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were 
        here,
        I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'

        Kramer rises in the background.

        Kramer: Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.

        Jerry: My Nana?

        Kramer: And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen
        hundred dollars!

        Everybody applauds as Uncle Leo comes out from sidestage.

        Uncle Leo: She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!


        New scene.
        Jerry and Elaine are at the coffee shop.

        Jerry: I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first 
        one.

        Elaine: Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-

        Jerry: Yes, he is.


        Elaine: You should show this to Georgie.

        Yeah.

        Waitress (at the next table): Here's your knife and fork.

        Jerry: Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.

        Elaine: I just don't get it.

        Jerry: You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.

        Elaine: What is wrong with everybody?

        Jerry (surveying the restaurant): Look, they're doing it. They're all 
        doing
        it!

        Elaine (standing up): What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all 
        gone
        mad?!!

        Opening scene - Jerry and George in a furniture store. Jerry is shopping 
        for a new couch.

        JERRY: So, she got you to join a book club?

        GEORGE: I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.

        JERRY: Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. 
        <Sits on a couch.> Hey, what about this one?

        GEORGE: Nah, I don't like that one.

        JERRY: So, what's your first book?

        GEORGE: "Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. <Waves a hand 
        like it's nothing.>

        JERRY: It's kinda old, isn't it?

        GEORGE: They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.

        JERRY (standing): Oh, sure...Truman Capote.

        GEORGE: He's a great writer.

        JERRY: Oh, yeah.

        GEORGE: Did you ever read anything by him?

        JERRY: No. You?

        GEORGE: Nah.

        JERRY (sees a white couch by the wall): Oh, what about this one? Look 
        at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. <Sits on the couch.> 
        Oh, yeah!


        New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. The moving guys are 
        delivering Jerry's new couch.

        ELAINE: Hey, what's going on?

        JERRY: New couch, baby!

        ELAINE: New couch? Why?

        JERRY: I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It 
        doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over. 

        <Elaine laughs. Carl and another furniture mover come in, and they 
        pick up Jerry's old couch.>

        ELAINE (to Carl, flirtatiously): Hello.

        CARL: Hello.

        ELAINE: Oh, let me get the door for you. <They carry the couch out 
        the door.> Ooh, be careful!

        JERRY: Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of 
        a kind, they stopped making it.

        ELAINE: What are you doing with your old couch?

        JERRY: Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?

        ELAINE: Yeah, I'll take it.

        JERRY: Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.

        ELAINE: Yes, they can. <Kramer enters.>

        KRAMER: Hey! Couch is comin.'

        JERRY: It's here!

        KRAMER: Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, 
        I feel like I'm getting a new couch.

        JERRY (nonplussed): Yeah. So do I.

        KRAMER: Ooh! Remember Poppie?

        JERRY: Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?

        KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember 
        that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your 
        own pizza?

        JERRY: Yeah.

        ELAINE: What was that again?

        KRAMER: It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the 
        dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into 
        the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds 
        good, huh?

        ELAINE (in a southern accent): Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and 
        make mah own pie!

        JERRY: What made you resurrect that old idea?

        KRAMER: Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the 
        "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, 
        he wants to back it.

        ELAINE: I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.

        JERRY: I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?

        KRAMER: That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine 
        just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got 
        a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.

        ELAINE: Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!

        KRAMER: Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You 
        know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.

        JERRY: Oh, Kramer, I -

        <Kramer turns around and runs smack into Jerry's new couch being brought 
        in by Carl and the other moving guy, and hits the floor. They place the 
        couch in the same spot as the old one.>

        JERRY: Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?

        ELAINE: Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.

        JERRY: Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.

        CARL (hands Jerry an invoice): Sign here.

        ELAINE (to Carl): Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if 
        you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.

        CARL: Sure.

        ELAINE: 'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?


        CARL: Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.

        ELAINE: Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you 
        chumps later. <Elaine and Carl exit.>

        KRAMER: Did you offer those guys a drink?

        JERRY: Uh, no. Should I have?

        KRAMER: What kind of a person are you?

        JERRY: I don't know.


        New scene - George at home, preparing to read "Breakfast At Tiffany's."

        GEORGE: Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." <Begins to read, 
        but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. 
        George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, 
        and doesn't start the book.>


        New scene - Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant.

        ELAINE: So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he 
        says, "Do you date moving men?"

        JERRY: Ah ha...

        ELAINE: You wanna know what I said?

        JERRY: I can't wait.

        ELAINE: "I do now." 

        JERRY: Clever.

        ELAINE: Is that something? 

        JERRY: Yes.

        ELAINE: Is that something?

        JERRY: You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, 
        I didn't offer them anything to drink. 

        ELAINE: Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.

        JERRY: So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?

        ELAINE: Yes.

        JERRY: Well, would you apologize for me? <Elaine nods. Poppie comes 
        out of the kitchen.>

        POPPIE: Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! <Puts his hand out.>

        JERRY (clearly creeped out by having to shake Poppie's hand): Hello, Poppie. 
        This is Elaine.

        ELAINE: Nice to meet you, Poppie.

        POPPIE: Let me show you to your table. <Leads Jerry and Elaine to the 
        table.> Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!

        JERRY: Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together. 
        

        POPPIE: Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, 
        I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.

        ELAINE: Well, your mother must be very proud of you.

        POPPIE: My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle 
        of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, 
        where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she 
        was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some 
        bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.

        JERRY: So, what's good tonight?


        Cut back to George at home. His television program finishes, and he turns 
        off the TV. He stretches, then goes back to reading - not "Breakfast 
        At Tiffany's" however, but an issue of Cracked magazine.


        Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's.

        ELAINE: Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food 
        ordered in advance before.

        JERRY: Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.

        ELAINE: Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's. 
        

        JERRY: Why not?

        ELAINE: Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, 
        anti-abortion groups.

        JERRY: So, you won't eat the pizza?

        ELAINE: No way.

        JERRY: Really.

        ELAINE: Yeah.

        JERRY: Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?

        ELAINE: Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.

        JERRY: Really! 

        ELAINE: Yeah. That's right.

        JERRY: Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have 
        a word? <Poppie comes over.>

        POPPIE: Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than 
        even I had hoped.

        JERRY: Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion 
        issue?

        POPPIE: When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...

        JERRY: Oh, boy.

        POPPIE: ...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue 
        there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.

        ELAINE (offended): Well...Poppie. I think differently.

        POPPIE: And what gives you the right to do that?

        ELAINE (standing up): The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! 
        Let's go Jerry, c'mon.

        WOMAN AT NEXT TABLE (to her date): I heard that. Let's go, Henry.

        HENRY: But we just got here...

        WOMAN AT ANOTHER TABLE: I'm with you, Poppie!

        WOMAN AT YET ANOTHER TABLE (to her date): Let's go!

        ELAINE (to Poppie): And I am not coming back!

        POPPIE: You're not welcome!

        JERRY: Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. <Gets up and leaves.>


        New scene - Jerry and George in a booth at the coffee shop.

        JERRY: Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.

        GEORGE: I'm sorry I missed it.

        JERRY: Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty 
        much all my fault. <Jerry smiles. George laughs.> So, how's the 
        book coming? <George's laughs taper off...> I say, how's the book 
        comin'?

        GEORGE: Oh...pretty good.

        JERRY: So, what's it about?

        GEORGE: Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.

        JERRY: Holly Go-Lightly. 

        GEORGE: Yeah, she's quite a character.

        JERRY: Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?

        GEORGE: No. 

        JERRY: Big surprise.

        GEORGE: I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very 
        hard to concentrate. 

        JERRY: You're not very bright, are you?

        GEORGE: No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna 
        do? The book club meets in a few days.

        JERRY: Why don't you rent the movie?

        GEORGE: 'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, 
        now I'm relieved. <Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.>

        KRAMER (scanning a menu): So...how was the dinner last night?

        JERRY: Oh...well...


        KRAMER: Did you enjoy the duck? <Elaine comes back from the bathroom.> 
        Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.

        ELAINE (sitting down): Oh...well...

        KRAMER: Alright, what did you do to Poppie?

        ELAINE: Nothing.

        KRAMER: Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.

        ELAINE: What's wrong with him?

        KRAMER: I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. <angrily> 
        It would be nice if you got him something. <Punches the the table to 
        accentuate this, and leaves.>

        JERRY: We should get him something.

        ELAINE: Yeah. You're right.


        New scene - Elaine and Carl sitting in carl's moving van after a date.

        ELAINE: Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo 
        for a year? And I shampoo every day. <Carl smiles.> So, what do 
        you think of my conversation?

        CARL: Not much! <They both laugh.> I, uh, would have invited you 
        up, but I don't have any furniture.

        ELAINE: You don't have any furniture?

        CARL: No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. <They laugh again.>

        ELAINE: Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?

        CARL: Yeah! No heavy lifting. <Elaine and Carl look into each others 
        eyes, then kiss.>


        New scene - Kramer visiting Poppie at the hospital. There sitting on a 
        bench outside.

        KRAMER: Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to 
        you, and they wanted you to have this.

        POPPIE (opening the gift basket): What's this? A bottle of wine and a 
        five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?! 

        KRAMER: Why, what...?

        POPPIE: Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would 
        have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is 
        a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?

        KRAMER: Well, we're not very close.

        POPPIE: They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.

        KRAMER: Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?

        POPPIE: Oh, very good ducks.


        New scene - Elaine shows up at Jerry's apartment. Jerry opens the door.

        He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!

        JERRY: Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?

        ELAINE: No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You 
        know? There are no games! <Sits down on the couch.>

        JERRY: No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you 
        know if you're winning or losing?

        ELAINE (putting on lipstick): Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games 
        and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.

        JERRY: Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?

        ELAINE (looks at Jerry and smears lipstick across her face): What?

        JERRY: What is his stand...on abortion?

        ELAINE: Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.

        JERRY: How do you know?

        ELAINE: Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.

        JERRY: Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming 
        over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.


        New scene - George at a video store counter.

        GEORGE: I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.

        GEORGE: Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones 
        that have had it.

        CLERK: Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.

        GEORGE: Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.

        CLERK: Oh, sorry. We can't do that.

        GEORGE: Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.

        CLERK: I don't think so. It doesn't work that way. 

        <The clerk goes to help another customer, and leaves George unattended. 
        George waits until the clerk's back is turned, then has a good look at 
        the information on his computer monitor.>

        INTERCOM: Yes.

        JERRY: You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.

        KRAMER: Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. <Poppie 
        enters.>

        JERRY: Okay. Hi, Poppie.

        POPPIE: Hello.

        JERRY: I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.

        POPPIE: That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my 
        way.

        JERRY: Okay. I'll get it. <Goes into the bedroom.>

        KRAMER: Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. <Poppie 
        moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.> 
        What, are you tired, Poppie?

        POPPIE: No.

        KRAMER: Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?

        POPPIE: Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother - 

        JERRY (comes out of the bedroom with Poppie's money): Here you go. <Poppie 
        stands up and takes the money.> Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...<notices 
        a large, wet stain on his couch>...the...the...

        JERRY: ...the...the...

        KRAMER (to Poppie): So long. I'll see you tonight.

        JERRY (frantic): Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!

        KRAMER: What is what?

        JERRY: This puddle on my sofa! 

        KRAMER: What puddle?

        JERRY (points): That puddle! <Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.> 
        

        KRAMER: I don't know.

        JERRY (looking at the puddle with Kramer): Is it...? Could it...? Could 

        he have...? IT IS! <Grabs Kramer.> Poppie peed on my sofa!!

        KRAMER: Are you sure?

        JERRY: Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!

        KRAMER: I'm sure it'll come out.

        JERRY: I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!

        KRAMER: Ah, you're making too much of it.

        JERRY (sarcastic): Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens 
        to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.

        KRAMER: Right!

        Hepburn very much.

        GEORGE: She was a delicate flower. 

        JOE: Why didn't you just read the book?

        GEORGE: Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... 
        <Joe's daughter comes to the door.>

        ELAINE: Me, either! 

        CARL: I think about you all the time.

        ELAINE: You do?

        CARL: Do you think about me?

        ELAINE: Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've 
        been thinking about this friend of mine. 

        CARL: What friend?

        ELAINE: Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, 
        and decided to have an abortion. <Waits in suspense for what Carl's 
        response will be.>

        JOE: What did you want?

        GEORGE: Popcorn?

        REMY: Popcorn? Where do you think you are?

        GEORGE: Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.

        REMY: Well, we don't.

        GEORGE: You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's 
        all.

        JOE (passes George a bowl): Here's some nuts.

        GEORGE: Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts 
        named after people. Hazel...and filbert.

        REMY (to Joe): Can we watch the movie now, Daddy? <Joe presses play 
        on the remote.>

        GEORGE: Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'

        JOE: The lights are fine. <George shrugs, and the movie begins.>


        New scene - Kramer and Poppie in the kitchen of the restaurant, making 
        the first 'test pizza.'

        pizza dough into the air.>

        POPPIE: Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. <Kramer tosses the dough 
        way up there.> Not too high!

        KRAMER (puts the dough on the counter): Alright, put a little sauce on 
        here... <speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while 
        spreading the sauce around.> Some cheese...

        POPPIE: Not too much!

        KRAMER: And...cucumbers! <Grabs a large handful and puts them on the 
        pizza.>

        POPPIE: Wait a second...what is that?

        KRAMER: It's cucumbers.

        POPPIE: No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.

        KRAMER: Well, why not? I like cucumbers.

        POPPIE: That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.

        KRAMER: But that's the idea, you make your own pie.

        POPPIE: Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping 
        they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!

        KRAMER: What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?

        POPPIE: Because it's a pizza!

        KRAMER: It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!

        POPPIE: It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!

        KRAMER: No, it isn't!

        POPPIE: Yes, it is!


        Cut back to George, Joe and Remy watching the movie. Joe's wife enters.

        JOE: Yeah. 

        JOE'S WIFE: Well, I just came back from Angela's, it's not looking very 
        good for Duncan. 

        JOE: Aw, that's too bad.

        JOE'S WIFE: Yeah, the doctor thinks it's just a matter of time - 

        GEORGE (clears his throat, annoyed that the movie's being interrupted): 
        Joe...could you...

        JOE'S WIFE: Poor guy, I hate to see him suffer like this...

        GEORGE: You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but 
        we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.

        JOE'S WIFE: Who are you?

        JOE: This is George Costanza.

        GEORGE (irritated): This is very hard to follow with all the talking.

        JOE: I'll pause it, okay? <Pauses the tape with the remote.>

        GEORGE: Any more grape juice? <Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy 
        moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.>

        JOE'S WIFE: Who is this guy?

        REMY: He's in some book club.

        JOE'S WIFE: And what's he doing here?

        REMY: Cheating on his test. <George returns from the kitchen with a 
        glass of grape juice.>

        GEORGE: So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? <Joe's 
        wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to 
        Remy to move.> Okay, c'mon. Let's go.


        REMY: What?

        GEORGE: C'mon, you took my seat.

        REMY: It's not your seat.

        GEORGE: I was sitting there, c'mon.

        REMY: You didn't save it.

        GEORGE: I had the arm! Joe...

        JOE: What's the difference?

        GEORGE: Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...

        REMY: It's my couch.

        GEORGE: Alright, c'mon, scooch over. <Tries to squeeze into the corner 
        seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape 
        juice all over the couch in the process.>

        REMY: Look! Look what you did! You got grape juice all over our couch, 
        you've ruined our couch! <Joe slowly walks toward George with his hands 
        on his hips.>

        GEORGE: Joe...

        JERRY: Well, I guess I have no choice.

        ELAINE: Do you want your old couch back?

        JERRY: I was hoping you'd offer. <The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers 
        it.> Yeah?

        INTERCOM: It's the movers.

        JERRY: 'Kay. <Buzzes them in.>

        ELAINE: Who's that?

        JERRY: Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.

        ELAINE: No, no, he's not my boyfriend.

        JERRY: Why?

        ELAINE: Take a guess.

        JERRY: Oh, really. <Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up 
        the couch.>

        CARL: Hi.

        JERRY: Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch

        CARL: Throw it!

        <Elaine heaves the grape juice bottle over-hand at Carl, and we hear

        rid of the cat. The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence.

        Peppard. I mean, Fred.

        Opening monologue. 

        You have a close friend and they get involved, with someone in a relationship. 
        It affects your friendship doesn't it? Because it's like you were a comedy 
        team, and now there's this third person, you know, it kind of throws off 
        the timing. Who's on first, I don't know, uh dear, who, who do you think 
        is on first? 

        In fact, whenever a friend of mine ah, starts with a new girlfriend, we 
        should just say, I look like the person you use to know, but I've 
        been modified to survive in this relationship. In other words, if were 
        having an argument and she's there, I may say I totally disagree with 
        you, but what that really means is, Id like to help you out, but 
        Id rather continue to see her naked. 



        Commercial 


        Opening scene. 
        Exterior daylight shot of Monk's restaurant -- then inside where Jerry 
        and George are sitting in the usual booth. A waitress (Kelly) walks up 
        to the table to take their order.

        Jerry: Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon. 

        George: Ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises 
        eyebrows) 

        Waitress: George, don't make me get tough with you. 

        George: Why, you think you can, beat me up? 

        Waitress: You wouldn't want me to mess up the beautiful face of yours. 
        

        George: Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her 
        arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air) 

        Waitress: You don't want bacon Ill surprise you. (she turns and 
        walks away) 

        George: Wow, is she not terrific? 

        Jerry: She does have a way. 

        George: You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying 
        that? 

        Jerry: Well they do work on tips. 

        George: George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, 
        hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do 
        you think? You think she likes me? 

        Jerry: Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet. 

        George: Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people 
        to like. 

        Jerry: The omelet. Damn. 

        George: Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees 
        something? Is it possible? 

        Jerry: No. 

        George: No.  
        

        Jerry: Not possible. 

        George: Not possible. 

        (Elaine enters and walks up to the table) 

        Elaine: Heyyyyyy (leaning in, very friendly and happy) 

        George: Hey Elaine. 

        Jerry: Lannie, how was the trip? 

        (Elaine sits down next to George in the booth) 

        George: What trip? You were gone? 

        Elaine: I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days. 

        George: Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it? 

        Elaine: Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit 
        it off. 

        Jerry: Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential. 

        George: he he (laughs) 

        Elaine: Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent 
        flyer miles. 

        George: Flying him in? How longs he staying for? 

        Elaine: It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants. 

        George: All this in only 5 days. 

        Jerry: Oh no, it's Kenny Bania. 

        (Kenny Bania is hanging up his coat on the coat rack by the front door) 
        

        George: Who's he? 

        Jerry: (quietly) Oh, he's this awful comedian. 

        (Bania walks over to the table, stands there with his arms on his hips) 
        

        Bania: Hey Jerry. 

        Jerry: Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite) 

        Jerry: Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm) 
        

        Elaine: Hi. (she flips her hair) 

        George: Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi) 

        Bania: Hi. (to Elaine) 

        Jerry: How's it going? 


        Bania: Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42. 

        Jerry: No kidding. 

        Bania: Yeah, Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with 
        false modesty) Well, Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle 
        twice on the table, turns and walks away) 

        Jerry: All right. 

        Elaine: O.K. Thanks. 

        (Bania gets about 3-4 steps away then turns around quickly) 

        Bania: Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size 
        suit are you? 

        Jerry: Ahh, Im a 40. Why? 

        Bania: I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesn't fit me anymore. You 
        want it? 

        Jerry: Well I don't know if I ... 

        Bania: Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet? 

        Elaine: An Armani suit? 

        George: Take the suit. 

        Jerry: Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off) 

        Bania: You gonna be home later? 

        Jerry: Yeah. 

        Bania: Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, 
        turns and walks away) 

        George: Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast) 
        

        Jerry: Yeah, yeah, lucky me. (sips coffee) 

        (The waitress walks up to the table with Jerry and George's plates) 

        Waitress: (to George) Here I personally made you a cold chicken sandwich. 
        It's not even on the menu. 

        George: (takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is 
        muffled) Oh, this is fabulous. 

        (The waitress cocks her head and looks at George as if she is glad he 
        likes the sandwich) 



        New scene. 
        Exterior of the restaurant, then to Jerry and George standing outside 
        on the sidewalk. Jerry is zipping up his leather jacket. George is wearing 
        a larger green jacket. 

        George: Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. 
        She oozes substance. 

        Jerry: Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put them 
        on glass. 

        George: You mean walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. 
        You're sending me out to no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I 
        have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell 
        ya! 

        (Jerry grabs George forcefully by the collar of his coat) 

        Jerry: Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an 
        order! 

        (Jerry lightly slaps George on his right arm. George turns to look at 
        the restaurant and the task at hand) 

        Jerry: Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant) 
        



        New scene. 
        Exterior daylight shot of Jerry's brick apt. building, then to the interior 
        of his apt. Kramer enters quickly, sliding on his right foot. 

        Kramer: Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the 
        newspaper) 

        Jerry: Hey. 

        Kramer: Listen, I need you to do me a favor. 

        Jerry: What? 

        Kramer: Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator. 

        Jerry: Why? 

        Kramer: Cause Im getting rid of it. 

        [Intercom buzzes] 

        (Kramer turns & goes over to the intercom to push the speaker button. 
        He says something like ya go, but it's difficult to make out 
        what he says) 

        Jerry: YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the 
        intercom) 

        Bania: [It's K.B., I have the suit] 

        Jerry: ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking 
        forward to Kenny Bania) 

        Kramer: (claps hands) So ... 

        Jerry: Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets 
        up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen) 

        Kramer: Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta 
        be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want 
        the space. 

        Jerry: Well, what for? 

        Kramer: Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while 
        Im making breakfast. 

        (Bania opens the door and leans his head in) 

        Bania: Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.) 
        

        Jerry: Yeah. 

        Bania: You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit, did 
        you? 

        Kramer: What, you're giving him this suit? 

        Bania: That's right, and it's an Armani. 

        Kramer: Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it 
        over) 

        Jerry: Yes, yes, I heard. 

        Kramer: Come on, try it on. 

        (Kramer takes the jacket off of the hangar and put the pans, still on 
        the hanger, on the kitchen counter -- he opens the jacket for Jerry to 
        slip in to) 

        Jerry: No, it's ok. 

        Kramer: Come on, I want to see how it fits. 

        Jerry: All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket) 

        Kramer: There you go. 

        Jerry: Ok, Yeah all right. 

        Kramer: Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this. 
        

        Bania: I don't even want anything for it. 

        (grinning like a Hyena, Bania looks at Jerry -- Jerry's _expression looks 
        like what have I gotten myself into here.) 

        Kramer: He's very generous, isn't he? 

        Jerry: Yes, yes, he is. 

        Bania: Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime. 
        

        (Jerry starts taking the jacket off and stops -- looking very surprised 
        at Bania) 

        Jerry: Dinner? 

        Bania: Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that 
        (pats Jerry on the shoulder) 

        Kramer: No, you'll never get a better deal than that. 

        Bania: All right. Ill leave you alone. (turns and walks out the 
        door) 

        Jerry: Yeah, Ill see you. 

        Kramer: All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah. 


        (Jerry has the jacket off and walks over to the table -- he tosses the 
        it onto the table) 

        Jerry: Yeah, that's a deal. That's a horrible deal. I don't want to go 
        out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit. 

        (Kramer rubs his fingers through his high standing hair as George enters 
        the apt.) 

        George: I did it! It's all done! 

        Jerry: Hey. (raises hands into fists of encouragement) 

        George: I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work 
        and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime 
        then I am at night. it's less pressure. 

        Jerry: I love the day date. No wine, No shower. 

        George: Yeah. 



        New scene. 
        A daylight shot of a yellow taxi driving down the street, then inside 
        to the back seat of the taxi -- Simon, the Englishman that Elaine met 
        on her trip is riding with her. 

        Elaine: So the trip was good? 

        Simon: Yes (nice English accent) Apart from that, dreadful airline food. 
        It tends to reek havoc with my stomach. 

        Elaine: You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, 
        but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with 
        him) 

        Simon: That's probably because of ... [muttering] 

        Elaine: What? 

        Simon: What? 

        Elaine: Yeah, what? 

        Simon: [sighs] 

        Elaine: What? 

        Simon: Where I come from, we don't say What? It's proper to 
        say Pardon? 

        Elaine: Huh. [muttering -- sounds like this should be interesting] 
        

        Simon: Pardon? 

        Elaine: Nothing. 



        New scene. 
        Beautiful aerial shot of Central Park and part of the city (visible off 
        to the left) -- looks to be a beautiful autumn day. Then to the waitress 
        (Kelly) and George strolling along a path in the park. Each has a coat 
        on and their hands are in their pockets. 

        Kelly: So then about a year ago I started selling, these funky little 
        hair clips. It's going pretty good. I make them in my apartment. 

        (a horse with rider walks by) 

        Kelly: Im just doing this waitress thing for a while, because I 
        wanted to go to Europe this summer and I could use a few extra ... Careful 
        (she points to the ground, so George will see the fresh horse manure and 
        avoid stepping in it) 

        George: Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at 
        the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind 
        the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which 
        is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. When you consider 
        the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing. 

        (George glances at his watch) 

        Kelly: That's a nice watch George. 

        George: Yeah. 

        Kelly: You know, my boyfriend has the same one. 

        George: Huh. Really? 

        Kelly: Yeah, he loves watches. He's a real watch freak. 

        George: Well, how about that? 

        Kelly: Ooh look out. (pointing at the ground - squishing sound) You stepped 
        right in it. 

        George: Yes, I sure did. 




        New scene. 
        Exterior of Jerry's brick apartment building with the staircase - then 
        inside where George and Jerry are talking. 

        Jerry: So you just pretended it didnt bother you? 

        George: What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does 
        she think I asked her out for? 

        Jerry: Boy, It's the way they just slip that in there too. 

        George: Yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend 
        really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. Well that's fabulous. 
        (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times) 

        Jerry: Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked 
        her out? 

        George: I said, would you like to go for a walk or something. 
        

        Jerry: Oh, a walk, well -- 

        George: Or something. I said, Or Something! 

        Jerry: Or something. Yeah, that's a date. 

        George: (snaps fingers) There you go. 

        Jerry: You know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible. 
        

        George: What do you mean? 

        Jerry: Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the 
        looks of the defense and changed the play. 

        George: I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation. 
        

        Jerry: Uh huh. 

        George: I mentioned how I liked horse manure. 

        Jerry: You did? 

        George: Yeah. 

        Jerry: Yeah. You said you liked horse manure. 

        George: Yeah. You know, about how when you break it down, it's really 
        a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma 
        in front of it. MA-NURE. It's not bad. 

        Jerry: And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend? 
        

        George: Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said 
        about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, 
        and puts it on a positive spin on it. 

        Jerry: Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored 
        with your thoughts and feelings on manure. 

        George: So you don't think she really has a boyfriend? 

        Jerry: My honest opinion, I think she made it up. 

        George: Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she? 

        (Kramer enters) 

        Kramer: Hey. 

        Jerry: Well ... you want something to eat, don't you? 

        Kramer: Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this 
        no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself 
        of things. It's fun. Very monastic. 

        George: Well what do you eat? 

        Kramer: It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, 
        I omniga nominga, I eat it. 

        Jerry: Well Im glad it's working out. 

        Kramer: Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress 
        that works at Reggies. 

        Jerry: Boy, if i could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place. 
        

        Kramer: Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal. 


        Jerry: Is she? 

        Kramer: Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime. 
        

        George: Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time 
        you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know 
        if she really has a boyfriend. 

        Kramer: All right it's done. 

        (George and Kramer go over by the computer. George is writing something 
        on a piece of paper) 

        [ Telephone rings - Jerry picks up the phone ] 

        Jerry: Hello? 

        Bania: Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny. 

        Jerry: Oh, Hi. 

        Bania: You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I could get 
        my meal today? 

        (Jerry pauses and thinks for a few seconds) 

        Jerry: Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you? 

        Bania: How about Mendys, ooh, ever been there? 

        Jerry: No I haven't? 

        Bania: Ah you'll love it. Ill meet you there around 7:00. 

        Jerry: All right. (hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit. 
        



        New scene. 
        Exterior of Mendys Restaurant at dusk - then inside where Bania 
        is sitting across the table from Jerry. 

        Bania: I start out with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 
        2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets. 

        Jerry: That's fantastic. (he could care less) 

        Bania: You work out with weights? 

        Jerry: No I don't. 

        Bania: You should. 

        Jerry: Why? 

        (Banias broad smile of enthusiasm turns into a dumb founded look 
        ...) 

        Bania: You worn the suit yet? 

        Jerry: No, not yet. 

        Waiter: have you decided? 

        Bania: Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry. 
        

        Jerry: Ill have the salmon. 

        Waiter: And you? 

        Bania: Ahh, you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah, 
        Ill save the meal for another time. 

        Jerry: Another time? What other time? 

        Bania: I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry. 

        Jerry: No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts. 

        Bania: Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal. 

        Jerry: Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything 
        you want. 

        Bania: I don't want anything but soup. 

        Jerry: Then that's the meal. 

        Bania: But I had the hot dog. 

        Jerry: I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have 
        a hot dog? 

        Bania: Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy 
        me a meal? 

        Jerry: All right, fine. Get the soup! 



        New scene. 
        The camera fades from the previous scene into the next scene. It's the 
        next day, outside in front of an apartment building. Elaine sits on the 
        front stoop while Jerry leans against the railing as they talk. 

        Jerry: So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to 
        do it all over again. 

        Elaine: What kind of soup did he get? 

        Jerry: I don't know? Consomm or something. 

        Elaine: Consomm, hmm. 

        Jerry: What? 

        Elaine: Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean if he had gotten 
        Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, or Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree 
        with you. Those are very hardy soups. 

        Jerry: Elaine you're missing the whole point. 

        Elaine: What? 

        Jerry: The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter 
        what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal. 
        

        Elaine: Was it a cup or a bowl? 

        Jerry: You see -- ah, uh ... 

        Elaine: Im just curious. 

        Jerry: A bowl, ok? 

        Elaine: Did he crumble any crackers in it? 

        (Jerry blows out a breath) 

        Elaine: (reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it? 
        

        Jerry: As a mater of fact, he did. 

        Elaine: Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal. 

        Jerry: It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here. 

        (Simon comes out of the apartment building onto the steps next to Jerry) 
        

        Elaine: Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry. 

        Simon: Hello. (to Jerry, politely -- then quickly turns to Elaine) Elaine, 
        do you have any cash on you? 

        Elaine: Um, yeah in my purse. 

        Simon: No. There was only six dollars. 

        Jerry: Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills) 
        

        Simon: Well, 20 should cover me. (snatches the cash) Thanks mate. (he 
        walks down the stairs to the sidewalk) 

        Elaine: Where you going? 

        Simon: (starts to turn back to Elaine) Just visiting. 

        Elaine: Oh, OK, see you later. 

        Simon: I won't be back for dinner. (turns and walks off down the street) 
        

        Elaine: [ English accent ] Pardon?

        at the usual booth and Jerry sits down on the other side of the table. 
        

        Jerry: So is she working? Is she here? 

        George: Yeah, yeah, she's here. 

        Jerry: Have you said anything to her? 

        George: No, but Im feeling very uncomfortable. 

        Jerry: Are you going to say anything? 

        George: There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix 
        the conversation) No no no no no no. 


        Kelly the Waitress: Hello 

        George: Hello. 

        Kelly the Waitress: Well, what's it going to be? 

        George: What's it gonna be? 

        Kelly the Waitress: Yes. What'll you have? Are you eating? It's in that 
        vein. 

        George: Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili. 

        Jerry: Ill have an egg white omelet. 

        (Kelly the Waitress walks away) 

        George: What's it gonna be? ... You hear that? 

        Jerry: Yeah, that was bad. 

        George: Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu 
        back with frustration) - there's no more banter. 

        (looking towards the front door, Jerry sees Kenny Bania hanging up his 
        coat on the coat rack) 

        Jerry: Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & 
        Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats) 

        Bania: Hey. 

        Jerry: Hey. 

        Bania: You worn the suit yet? 

        Jerry: Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it. 

        Bania: You did? 

        Jerry: ... Oh, Im joking. 

        Bania: OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George) 

        George: Sure you can. 

        (Bania sits next to George as he and Jerry slid back to their original 
        seats in the booth. Kelly the Waitress brings George his bowl of chili) 
        

        Kelly the Waitress: Can I take your order? 

        Bania: What kind of soup do you have? 

        Jerry: Why don't you get a sandwich? 

        Bania: Ok, Ill have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast. 

        Jerry: OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know 
        

        (George grabs some napkins) 

        Jerry: This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy. 

        Bania: What are you talking about? this isn't a meal. 

        (George tucks a napkin over his shirt collar) 

        Jerry: Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal. 

        Bania: You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys. 
        

        Jerry: I tried to do that. 

        Bania: This is lunch in a coffee shop 

        Jerry: Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction 

        Bania: Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any 
        kind of gesture? (turns to George) 

        Bania: Im really not comfortable ... 

        (Kramer walks up to the table, leans in, with both hands on the table) 
        

        Kramer: (to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend. 
        

        George: Yeah. 

        Kramer: She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up. 

        (Kramer points at George, and makes the pop sound with his 
        lips. George looks over his left shoulder, back into the kitchen, then 
        takes his napkin off of his shirt and throws it down on the table)

        New scene. 
        Elaine walks into Jerry's apartment and then over to the couch. 

        Elaine: Hi. 

        Jerry: Where's Simon? 

        Elaine: Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im 
        not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together 
        in front of her, then sits on the couch) 

        Jerry: When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator) 

        Elaine: About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. 
        Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles) 

        (Simon walks in the open door carrying some beer) 

        Simon: Hey mate. Fancy a beer? 

        Jerry: Ah, no thanks. 

        [ Telephone rings ] 

        (Simon leans down to kiss Elaine) 

        Jerry: (on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not 
        going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's 
        no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 
        2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye. 

        (hangs up the cordless phone and sets it down -- blows air out of his 
        mouth and cheeks ... Then he snaps his fingers) 

        Jerry: Hey, what size suit are you? 

        Simon: 40. 

        Jerry: 40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it? 

        Simon: Absolutely. 

        Jerry: Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. (he hands Simon 
        the suit on the hanger) 
        Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys) 

        Elaine: Thanks 

        [ Telephone rings ] (Jerry picks up the cordless phone) 

        Jerry: Yo? 

        Bania: Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back. 
        

        Jerry: I don't have your suit. I gave it away. 

        (Elaine and Simon are exiting the apartment door, Simon goes first. Elaine 
        with a big smile, realizing it's Bania on the phone, bends forward from 
        the waist slightly, opens her mouth and sticks out her tongue like she 
        is throwing up and then exits the apartment and closes the door.) 
        Bania: Well it's my suit. 

        Jerry: Well it's gone. Im sorry. Good-bye Bania. 

        (he hangs up the cordless phone. Kramer bursts in) 

        Kramer: Hey. 

        Jerry: Hey. 

        Kramer: Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? 
        

        Jerry: Ok. 

        Kramer: Good, ah, what's going on? 

        Jerry: Nothing. 

        Kramer: Really. 

        Jerry: You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down) 

        Kramer: It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling 
        you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without 
        any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched 
        on his last sentence) 

        Jerry: All right, go ahead 

        Kramer: Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things) 
        

        (Hilde walking into the open doorway of Jerry's apt. - she stands with 

        her arms on her hips) 

        Hilde: Did you find anything! 

        Kramer: Uh, yeah, ah ... 

        (looking down at the food he is clutching between his elbow and chest) 
        

        Kramer: There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah 
        ... 

        Hilde: Cheese is good. Yeah, what kind? 

        Kramer: Uh, Swiss. 

        Hilde: All right, it'll have to do. Come on. 

        (Hilde and Kramer go back to his apt. Kramer shuffles both feet wildly 
        as he exits) 


        New scene. 
        On the sidewalk, Jerry walks up to George, who is outside, one store over 
        from the coffee shop. 

        Jerry: What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat? 

        George: I can't go in there. I feel too uncomfortable. 

        Jerry: Oh, what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore? 
        

        Elaine: Hey, What are you doing out here? 

        Jerry: We can't eat here anymore, cause he took a waitress out for a walk. 
        

        George: What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies. 

        Elaine: Reggies? I can't eat anything there. 

        George: It's the same menu. 

        Elaine: There's no Big Salad. 

        George: They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're 
        the only one's that make a Big Salad? 

        Elaine: All right. Let's go, to Reggies. 

        (George half-bows to Elaine and they start to walk down the sidewalk) 
        

        Jerry: So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave? 

        Elaine: Ahh ... wait till you hear this. 



        New scene. 
        Daytime exterior of Reggies, then inside, where George sits on the 
        left side of the booth while Elaine and Jerry sit on the right side of 
        the booth. 

        Elaine: So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me. 

        Jerry: Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No 
        egg white omelets. Look at that. 

        George: So what! Have a yoke. It won't kill you. 

        Hilde: (walks up to the table) Hello. 

        Jerry: Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet? 

        Hilde: Did you read the menu? 

        Jerry: All right, just give me a western. (unhappy) 

        Elaine: How about a Big Salad? 

        Hilde: A big salad? 

        Elaine: (to George) You see? 

        George: Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya. 

        Elaine: It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it. 

        Hilde: I can bring you 2 small salads. 

        Elaine: Could you put it in a big bowl? 

        Hilde: We don't have any big bowls. 

        Elaine: All right. Just give me a cup of decaf. 

        Hilde: We have Sanka. 

        (Elaine looks up at Hilde with subtle disbelief) 



        New scene. 
        Exterior of Jerry's apartment building, then inside where Jerry and George 
        enter. 

        George: I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's 
        been there 3 weeks. 

        Jerry: Not fair. 

        George: If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her! 
        

        Jerry: She's on your turf. 

        George: If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? 
        I mean I know how to get myself fired. 

        Jerry: You're the best. 

        George: Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired? 

        Jerry: Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that 
        get you fired, but redirected, outwardly. 

        (Kramer enters) 

        Kramer: H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry. 

        Jerry: Well, there's nothing left. There's no food. 

        Kramer: No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's 
        cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. 
        She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that 
        blood sugar is drops. 

        [ Hilde ]: Food! 

        Kramer: There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired. 
        

        Jerry: Why'd she get fired? 

        Kramer: Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager 
        didnt like it. 

        (Jerry turns quickly and looks at George -- George, sitting on the couch, 
        immediately understands, he picks up the phone with his right hand, points 
        at Jerry with his left arm extended, dials and licks his lips) 



        New scene. 
        Exterior of the coffee shop the inside where Elaine and Jerry sit at the 
        usual booth. 

        Elaine: So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to 
        return my keys. 

        Jerry: Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he? 

        Elaine: Yes. He's one of those bounders. 

        Kelly the Waitress: Egg white omelet and Big Salad. 

        Elaine: AHhh. Thank you. 

        Kelly the Waitress: I just wanted to let you guys know that Friday's my 
        last day. Bloomingdales ordered a bunch of my clips, and thank God, I 
        don't have to do this any more. (turns and walks away) 

        Elaine: Ah (hu ha - small laugh) 

        (Bania walks up to the table) 

        Bania: Hey Jerry, where's my suit? 

        Jerry: I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate 
        up to Bania) 

        Monk's Manager: (on the phone, we assume it's George calling) I told you, 
        she's busy. She can't come to the phone now! (hangs up) 

        Monk's Manager: You better tell your boyfriend to stop calling here. 

        Kelly the Waitress: Oh he's not my boyfriend. It's that bald guy with 
        the glasses, who's always here with them. he's trying to get me in trouble. 
        

        (Monk's Manager stands there for a second thinking -- looking at Elaine 
        and Jerry. Both of them have a hand up on the side of their faces. Monk's 
        Manager walks over and puts both hands on the table and leans in) 

        Monk's Manager: HEY! Yeah. I got a message for you. You tell your friend 
        George, that the next time I see him around here, Im going to turn 
        him into my Own, Personal, Hand-Puppet. 


        (Jerry makes a face and silent Ouoo) 

        Simon: Well, hello. Here you are as promised. You see, Im a man 
        of my word. (drops keys into Elaine's extended palm) 

        Elaine: When are you leaving? 

        Simon: Elaine, are you trying to get rid of me? Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
        I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but all of a sudden, I've been set up 
        with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. 
        And it is all due, to this suit. How do I look? Im a shoe-in aren't 
        I. Thanks again love. (touches the table, turns and walks to the exit) 
        

        Elaine: (turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to 
        get that suit back? 

        Bania: (leans backwards from the counter) Yeah! 

        Elaine: There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door) 

        Bania: Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon) [ Come Here You! ] 
        

        (Elaine and Jerry watch as Bania runs out the door after Simon) 

        [ Simon: What are you doing. Unhand me ] 

        [ Bania: Take It Off! ] 

        [ Sounds of struggling] [ Material rips] 

        (Elaine and Jerry look at each other, and toast each other by raising 
        their forks in the air. Their mouths are open with the silent Ahhhhh _expression 
        of joy) 



        Final scene. 
        Inside Reggies dinner. George sits silently in a booth. A plate 
        of food on the table in front of him. Another patron is at the counter 
        by himself. 

        George pours a bit of ketchup onto his plate / food (*Actually we see 
        the end of the bottle, which is supposed to be obscured by some elements 
        on the table -- it does not look like any ketchup comes out of the bottle). 
        He replaces the ketchup bottle cap and sets the bottle down on the table. 
        

        He picks up his fork and takes a bite from his plate. Then he picks up 
        a bottle of A1 sauce and pours a bit on his food, replaces the cap and 
        sets the bottle down. Then he picks up (what looks to be) a smaller bottle 
        of Tabasco, pours a bit of it on his food, replaces the cap and sets the 
        bottle in the table caddy on the table. 

        Then he struggles with something on the table (it's near impossible to 
        distinguish what the item is, as it's a wide shot) -- trying to get the 
        item open, the lid flips into the air and flies over his right shoulder, 
        making a noise as it lands on the ground. Hearing the noise, the man at 
        the counter turns to see what it is and George looks over at him.

        Jerry's stand-up*: [I like the names they have for cars.] Like, no baron 
        has ever owned a LeBaron. Or the Ford LTD. "LTD." Limited. It's 
        a "limited" edition...what did they make, fifty million of those? 
        "Yes, it's 'limited' to the number we can sell." Or when they 
        try and mangle a positive word into a car name, you know how they'll do 
        that? The "Integra." Oh, integrity? No, Integra. The "Supra." 
        Or the "Impreza." Yeah? Well, I hope it's not a "lemona"...or 
        you'll be hearing from my "lawya."

        *Due to an incomplete video transfer, the dialogue above [in brackets] 
        has been filled in by the transcriber of the script (me, in other words).


        Opening scene - George looking at cars at a used car lot, checking out 
        an '89 Volvo.

        CAR SALESMAN: George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars?

        GEORGE: I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's 
        the car for me, it's the one I want. 

        SALESMAN: I got a LeBaron convertible right here.

        GEORGE (chuckles): N.I. Not interested.

        SALESMAN: It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was 
        John Voight.

        GEORGE (suddenly interested): Jon Voight?


        New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone 
        with Tim Whatley.

        JERRY: Okay, Tim. You're welcome. <Hangs up.>

        ELAINE: Was that Tim Whatley?

        JERRY: Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going 
        to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. <Elaine raises 
        her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.> 
        You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook 
        where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving 
        Day Parade?

        ELAINE: I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask 
        me out? <Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.>

        JERRY: Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.

        ELAINE: Why?

        JERRY: He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive 
        you crazy. <Mimics brushing his teeth> Away from the gums... <The 
        door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and 
        Elaine, then enters.>

        JERRY: Uh - new car! 

        ELAINE: Ohhh!  

        JERRY: Hey! Did you get the Volvo?

        GEORGE: No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.

        ELAINE: A LeBaron?

        JERRY: I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.

        GEORGE: What Consumer? I'm the consumer.

        JERRY: Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.

        GEORGE: Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.

        ELAINE: Jon Voight? The actor?

        GEORGE (boasting): That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner 
        of the vehicle.

        JERRY: You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?

        GEORGE (defensive): No, no...

        JERRY: I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving 
        Jon Voight's car.

        GEORGE: Alright, maybe I do. So what.

        ELAINE: I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. 
        No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway 
        train. <Kramer enters.>

        KRAMER: Hey.

        JERRY: Hey.

        KRAMER: Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? 
        Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down 
        and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.

        ELAINE: I like coffee.

        GEORGE: I like <imitates Kramer> "cookies."

        KRAMER: Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a 
        bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are 
        driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this 
        neighborhood.

        GEORGE: Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you 
        something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.

        KRAMER: Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. 
        Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'

        JERRY: I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled. 
        

        KRAMER: Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do 
        complete detailing. 

        JERRY: Alright, take 'em.

        KRAMER (happily): Yeah-yah.


        New scene - Kramer dropping off a box full of Jerry's sneakers at Mom 
        and Pop's shoe repair shop.

        POP: Kramer, without you, we'd be out of business.

        KRAMER: Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry 
        Seinfeld? The comedian.

        MOM: So many sneakers!

        KRAMER: Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.

        POP: They'll be ready a week from Thursday.

        KRAMER: Oh, well, no rush. <wipes his nose> Uh oh.

        MOM: What's the matter?

        KRAMER: Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.

        MOM: Oh, lie down, and put your head back.

        KRAMER: Yeah. <Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against 
        the armrest.> Hey, what's with your ceiling? <Mom and Pop look up.>


        POP: What?

        KRAMER (stuffing tissue up his nose): Well, you got wires sticking out 
        every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.

        POP: You know, in the 48 years we've been here, I don't think we've ever 
        called an electrician.

        KRAMER: Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.


        New scene - Elaine at Mr. Pitt's, listening to big band music on the radio. 
        Mr. Pitt enters.

        MR. PITT: Elaine?

        ELAINE: Yes, Mr. Pitt?

        MR. PITT: Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?

        ELAINE: No, I'm still working on it.

        MR. PITT: What in blazes are you listening to?

        ELAINE: Artie Shaw. "Honeysuckle Jump." <The song ends.>

        DJ ON RADIO: That was Artie Shaw, "Honeysuckle Jump." 

        MR. PITT: Elaine! How did you know that?

        ELAINE: Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.

        DJ ON RADIO: Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying 
        it. And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored 
        Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. <Mr. 
        Pitt hears this and is intrigued; mouths the words "Woody Woodpecker."> 
        There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now; 
        when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding 
        a rope under Woody Woodpecker.

        MR. PITT (to Elaine, excited): Could you identify the next song? Could 
        you? Could you?

        ELAINE: Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody 
        Woodpecker balloon?

        MR. PITT: My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any 
        activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving 
        Day Parade was first on the list.

        ELAINE: Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. <Turns up the radio.>

        DJ ON RADIO: Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. 
        If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND. <The music starts. 
        Elaine listens intently.>

        MR. PITT (impatiently): Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?

        ELAINE: Will you shut up? I can't hear!

        MR. PITT: I'm sorry!

        ELAINE: Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! <Grabs 
        the phone to call it in.>

        MR. PITT (overjoyed): Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! <Dances back and forth, 
        elated> Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!


        New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new 
        car.

        GEORGE: You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.

        JERRY: I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to 
        buy a car, because he might have driven it.

        GEORGE: What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really 
        owned this car?

        JERRY: I don't know.

        GEORGE: Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the 
        names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?

        JERRY: Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, 
        you'd know he's making it up.

        GEORGE: Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, 
        we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's 
        a cake walk. <Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.>

        JERRY: Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.

        GEORGE: Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.

        JERRY (shuts the car door): Alright, I'll change my shoes. <Heads back 
        to his apartment. George follows.>

        GEORGE (unimpressed): Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.

        Cut to Jerry and George coming back to Jerry's apartment. Jerry tosses 
        his gummy sneakers on the floor.

        JERRY: Let me get a clean pair. <Goes into his room. George strides 
        over to the window.>

        GEORGE (singing): Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're 
        sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...

        JERRY (yelling from his room): Kramer! <We hear Kramer's door slam 
        open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.> Hey! Where's 
        all my sneakers?

        KRAMER: You said take 'em.

        JERRY: Not all of 'em!

        KRAMER: Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.

        JERRY: Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?

        KRAMER: Jerry, I left you a pair right here...<goes into Jerry's room 
        and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.> C'mon. There, put on those 
        boots.

        JERRY: I can't wear these!

        KRAMER: Well, why not?

        JERRY: They're uncomfortable.

        KRAMER: C'mon here, try 'em on. <Jerry sits down and puts the boots 
        on.>

        GEORGE: Where did you get those?

        JERRY: I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to 
        pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! <Stands up.> 
        They look ridiculous!

        KRAMER: Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?

        JERRY: But I don't wanna be a cowboy!

        KRAMER: Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I 
        got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.

        GEORGE: Yeah, I got one too.

        KRAMER: Yeah?

        JERRY: Oh yeah? Huh.

        GEORGE: What?

        JERRY: No, nothing.

        GEORGE: No, what is it?

        JERRY: No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.

        GEORGE: You didn't get one?

        JERRY: Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, 
        I'm sure that means I'm invited.

        KRAMER: Not necessarily. 

        JERRY: Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses 
        if you're not invited to the party?

        GEORGE (mocking Jerry): That's the genius of it.

        JERRY (picks up the phone): I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out 
        anything from Tim Whatley.

        GEORGE (to Kramer): Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. <Jingles the keys.>

        KRAMER (impressed): Boss!


        New scene - Mom and Pop talking to the electrician about the faulty wiring 
        in the ceiling of the shop.

        POP: Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that!

        ELECTRICIAN: Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, 
        because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna 
        close you up.

        POP: But what if we can't pay for it?

        ELECTRICIAN: Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. 
        Sorry. <Exits.>

        POP: 48 years, Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot 
        and his bloody nose! <Kramer enters.>


        KRAMER: Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the 
        sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.

        <Pop glares at Kramer angrily.>


        New scene - George and Jerry driving along in John Voight's car. George 
        is humming the tune to "Everybody's Talkin.'"

        GEORGE: So?

        JERRY: C'mon, put the top up, it's November!

        GEORGE: I feel alive, Jerry.

        JERRY: Let's check out the glove box. <Opens the glove compartment, 
        takes out a pencil.> Ah. Pencil. 

        GEORGE: Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!

        JERRY: With Jon Voight's teeth marks. <Looks at the owner's manual.> 
        Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.

        GEORGE: Ah! See? I told ya.

        JERRY: Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.

        GEORGE: So?

        JERRY: Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?

        GEORGE (pulls over): So, what are you saying?

        JERRY: Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. 
        I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! <Laughs uproariously.>

        GEORGE (angrily): Get out of the car!

        JERRY: What?

        GEORGE: That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole 
        experience for me!

        JERRY (sarcastically): Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!

        GEORGE: Get out!

        JERRY: And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!

        GEORGE: Get out!! <Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple 
        of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.>

        TOUGH GUY (threatingly): Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse? <Jerry slips 
        and slides in his cowboy boots and runs away.> Yeah, you better run!


        Commercial break.

        New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.

        GEORGE: Did they take anything?

        JERRY: No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid 
        cowboy boots.

        GEORGE: Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.

        JERRY: You really seemed to enjoy it.

        GEORGE: It was kinda fun. <Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his 
        jaw.> You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it 
        to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.

        JERRY (sarcastic): Yeah, that's possible.

        GEORGE: How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what 
        am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.

        JERRY (to Elaine): He'll dispose of it.

        GEORGE: Heh, that's right. See ya later. <Exits.>

        ELAINE: So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.

        JERRY: Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?

        ELAINE: Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...

        JERRY: Yeah...

        ELAINE: And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"

        JERRY: So...?

        ELAINE: Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"

        JERRY: Alright, but let me ask you this question.

        ELAINE: What?

        JERRY: Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry 
        bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" 
        You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."

        ELAINE: I think he emphasized "would."

        JERRY: You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go 
        to begin with. <Kramer enters.>

        KRAMER: Hey.

        JERRY: Hey, so where's my sneakers?

        KRAMER: That's what I wanna know.

        JERRY: What do you mean?

        KRAMER: Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store 
        on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - 
        vrooop - vanished.

        JERRY: So all my sneakers are gone?

        KRAMER: I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been 
        asking around - they didn't even have any kids.

        JERRY: Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!

        KRAMER: It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big 
        time.

        ELAINE (amused): So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish 
        trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.

        KRAMER: Apparently.

        ELAINE: Alright, that's enough of this.

        JERRY: Where ya goin'?

        ELAINE: I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security 
        pass for the parade.

        JERRY: Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in 
        the Thanksgiving Day Parade?

        ELAINE: He finds his laugh "intoxicating." <Laughs like Woody 
        Woodpecker, and exits.>


        New scene - George in a meeting at Yankee stadium.

        MR. MORGAN: So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking 
        about?

        GEORGE: Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? 
        Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.

        MR. MORGAN: Jon Voight? The actor? <Rubs his eyes wearily.> Uh, 
        I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been 
        initiated by George Costanza.

        GEORGE: I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting 
        me on the back.


        New scene - Elaine at the Dixieland Deli, seated at a table with the other 
        contest winners.

        CONTEST WINNER (to Elaine): I guessed Stan Herman's "Boomtown Blues." 
        What'd you guess?

        ELAINE: Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." <The group 
        is unimpressed.> Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?

        CONTEST WINNER: After the music. <The band starts playing directly 
        behind Elaine. She is deafened by the loudness of the horns.>


        New scene - Kramer walking down the street. His nose starts to bleed.

        KRAMER: Oh. Oh man. <Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon 
        Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.>

        VOIGHT: Taxi! <Walks right by Kramer.> Taxi. 

        KRAMER: Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! <Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly 
        gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.> Hey, listen, can I ask 
        you something? Listen, listen...<Leans in the the open back window 
        of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer 
        screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.>


        New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.

        JERRY: No Jon Voight Day, huh?

        GEORGE: No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your 
        jaw still hurts?


        JERRY: Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when 
        I fell yesterday.

        GEORGE: You should have somebody take a look at that.

        JERRY: I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day 
        before Thanksgiving.

        GEORGE: You going to the party? 

        JERRY: No, I don't know if I'm invited.

        GEORGE: Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.

        JERRY: Yeah, you're right.

        GEORGE: You don't want to suffer with this all weekend. 

        JERRY: Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take 
        a chance. We'll go together.

        GEORGE: Maybe I'll just meet you there.

        JERRY: You don't want to go with me?

        GEORGE: Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite 
        you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?

        JERRY: The way I feel when I go places with you? <Kramer enters.> 
        Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?

        KRAMER: No. <To George> But I did run into somebody you might be 
        interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?

        GEORGE: Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?

        KRAMER: Well, he was a little standoffish. 

        GEORGE: What, you didn't ask him about the car?

        KRAMER: No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make 
        an impression on me. <Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.> 
        Look.

        JERRY: What?

        KRAMER: His tooth marks. He bit me.

        GEORGE: Jon Voight bit you?

        JERRY: Well, what is he, a vampire?

        KRAMER: No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.

        GEORGE (looking at Kramer's arm): He left perfect imprints.

        KRAMER: That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? 
        We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're 
        driving Jon Voight's car!

        JERRY: Oh, please.

        GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.

        JERRY: No, it's stupid.

        GEORGE: Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.

        JERRY: So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and 
        Kramer's gnarled arm.

        GEORGE: It's worth a shot. <Goes to the door.>

        JERRY: So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?

        KRAMER: Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding 
        and abetting some...party-crasher.


        New scene - Tim Whatley's party. Jerry peeks his head around the corner, 
        then slowly moves through the crowd, covering his face to keep a low profile.

        JERRY (under his breath, to a man at the party): Excuse me, uh...dentist? 
        You a dentist? <The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another 
        guy.> Dentist? Are you a dentist?

        Cut to George and Kramer looking at the parade out the window.

        GEORGE: These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.

        KRAMER: You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?

        GEORGE: Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?

        KRAMER: That's right. He's a troublemaker.

        <Elaine enters the party with a trophy under her arm, and runs into 
        Jerry.>

        JERRY: Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?

        ELAINE: What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland 
        Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?

        JERRY (pointing at the trophy): What is that, the Empire State Building?

        ELAINE: What? I can't hear you.

        JERRY: Elaine, would you marry me?

        ELAINE: I told you, I can't hear a word.

        JERRY: Alright. Forget it.

        <Tim gets up from the couch and meets George and Kramer.>

        GEORGE: Hey, Tim. 

        TIM: Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' <They shake hands.>

        GEORGE: Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know 
        you're busy here.

        TIM: No, it's no problem, what is it?

        GEORGE: Let me show you something, take a look at this... <Another 
        guy at the party interrupts.>

        GUY: Alright Tim, I'm gonna get goin.'

        TIM: Alright, let me take down your number. <Grabs George's pencil, 
        then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.> Is that Jerry Seinfeld?

        KRAMER: He didn't come with us. <Tim walks over to Jerry.>

        GEORGE: Uh, Tim, the pencil...

        TIM: Jerry.

        JERRY: Hey, Tim.

        TIM: Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.

        JERRY: Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, 
        I didn't think you'd show"? <Elaine comes over.>

        TIM: Elaine! Hi!

        ELAINE: Tim.

        TIM: Well. I'm really glad you came.

        ELAINE: What?

        TIM: Really glad you came.

        ELAINE (deaf): Uh huh.

        TIM (picks up a bowl of nuts): Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask 
        you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? <Elaine thinks 
        Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks 
        away.> Thanks.

        ELAINE (puzzled): What? What?

        <Cut to George and Kramer talking to another dentist at the party.>

        GEORGE: Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's 
        arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?

        DENTIST: It's possible.

        GEORGE (to Kramer): Roll up your sleeve.

        DENTIST: Somebody bit you?

        KRAMER: Not just someone. Jon Voight.

        DENTIST: Jon Voight bit you? <George notices Tim across the room with 
        the pencil in his mouth.> The pencil! Hey, hey! Get the pencil out 
        of your mouth, you're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks!

        TIM: That's John Voight's pencil?

        GEORGE: That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.

        TIM: Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?

        GEORGE (overjoyed to find out): Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know 
        Jon Voight!

        TIM: Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.

        GEORGE: Jon Voight, the actor?

        TIM: No. The periodontist. <George snaps the pencil in two.>

        <Cut to Jerry by the window, getting one of the dentists at the party 
        to look at his chipped tooth.>


        DENTIST: Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office.

        JERRY: Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.

        DENTIST: Alright. Sit down. 

        JERRY (sits down): It's this one here in the back. <Tilts his head 
        back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound 
        and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows 
        to look.>

        KRAMER: Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!

        TIM (to Jerry): Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! <Jerry 
        nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon 
        blows in the window.>


        Commercial break.

        New scene - Jerry and Kramer in Jerry's apartment, watching the Macy's 
        Thanksgiving Day Parade on TV.

        ANNOUNCER ON TV: Hey, it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of 
        air. In fact, he's collapsing.

        KRAMER: Those kids look pretty disappointed.

        JERRY: Especially that big kid up in the front. <Mr. Pitt is shown 
        on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.> 
        How old is he? <The phone rings.> Hello?

        GUY ON PHONE: Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?

        JERRY: Yes it is.

        GUY ON PHONE: You don't know me, but a really strange thing happened. 
        I was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers 
        they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.

        JERRY: Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very 
        much. <To Kramer> I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!

        KRAMER: Where are they?

        JERRY: Parsippany, New Jersey.

        KRAMER: Let's go!

        JERRY: My car's in the shop.

        KRAMER: Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?

        <Cut to Jerry and Kramer sitting in the back of a Trailways bus, en 
        route to Parsippany. Kramer's nose starts to bleed again.>

        KRAMER: Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.

        JERRY (wipes Kramer's brow): Maybe we should get you to a hospital.

        KRAMER (a la Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy): Hey, I ain't goin' to no 
        Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.

        <Nilsson's "Everybody's Talkin'" begins to play as they continue 
        on to Jersey, in a send-up of Midnight Cowboy that has to be seen to be 
        appreciated.>

        Opening monologue.

        I don't even know what, what is supposed to be attractive about fur?
        Why does a man want to see a woman in a fur? Men want women to shave
        their legs, shave their armpits, pluck their eyebrows and then before 
        we
        go out, we dress them up like a bear.

        To me the only reason to wear fur, would be if you were trying to sneak
        up on another animal. Did you ever see those tribal hunters where they
        wear the fur and then they had the other animals, head on top of their
        head? You know Im sure there's a moose looking at that going, Yeah,
        that looks real good. Yeah, Im gonna turn my back on this goof ball
        with the extra head. Because there's nothing fishy going on there.
        Ill just keep drinking from the stream. I've seen a lot of two-headed
        tigers with knees.


        Commercial

        Opening scene.
        Exterior of a Dry Cleaners -- then inside where Jerry and George are
        talking, Jerry is holding a few items, waiting to drop them off to be
        dry cleaned.

        George: Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the
        interview.

        Jerry: That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for
        your mother.

        George: Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.

        Jerry: From your mother.

        (George & Jerry turn and move closer to the counter as a few customers
        leave the store.)

        Jerry: So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the
        Spokes model category?

        George: Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a
        lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work
        done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency 
        and
        ability.

        Jerry: That's a 180, George.

        George: Whatever.

        (Jerry turns and walks up to the counter. George wonders about the
        lobby area)

        Jerry: Hi Willie.

        Willie: Hey Jerry.  

        Jerry: I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.

        Willie: What are you doing with it?

        Jerry: Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from
        Florida.

        Donna: Hi.

        Jerry: Hi.

        Willie: Hey Jerry, you know my wife Donna.

        Jerry: Yeah, that's why I said hi.

        (Donna smiles and walks away)

        Willie: Hey, nice jacket. (looking over the jacket)

        Jerry: Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.

        Willie: Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very
        flattering.

        Jerry: Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.



        New scene.
        Daylight exterior shot of Yankee Stadium, then to George Costanzas
        office where he is interviewing an attractive applicant for his
        secretary job.

        Applicant: Well, I type about 90 words a minute. Im completely
        well-versed in all IBM and Macintosh programs.

        George: (looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously
        qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience.
        But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at 
        you,
        I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going 
        to
        work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.

        (the camera is now back on the applicant's seat, but another even more
        attractive woman is seated there)

        George: You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat
        just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both
        George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches
        across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)


        (A very plain looking applicant now sits across from george)

        Ade: As you can see my references are impeccable. I think Id be 
        a real
        asset here. My only concern is, I do take care of my mother. So will
        there be any late nights?

        George: I can't imagine.



        New scene.
        Exterior shot of Jerry's apartment, then inside where Elaine is holding
        a garment bag and talking with Jerry.

        Elaine: Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress 
        on
        -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I
        couldn't take my eyes off myself.

        Jerry: Yeah.

        Elaine: OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying
        twins.

        Jerry: So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.

        Elaine: Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.

        Jerry: I thought we were going to the movies?


        Elaine: All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think.
        (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)

        (George Enters)

        George: Hey hey.

        Elaine: Hey George

        George: Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im
        telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps
        hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.

        Jerry: Because you didnt have a job?

        George: Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages,
        appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going
        with Ade.

        Jerry: A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the
        dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.

        (Elaine walks back into the living room, modeling the dress, arms
        extended straight out from her sides, elbows bent, with the look on her
        face that says, huh ... what do you think? -- She walks towards George
        and Jerry)

        Jerry: It's a little ...

        Elaine: All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.

        Jerry: You got no waist in that thing.

        George: You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.

        Elaine: I said, All Right.

        George: Well whad you buy it for?

        Elaine: Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked
        fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi Moore
        in Indecent Proposal.

        Jerry: How fast was she walking?

        (Elaine heads for the bedroom to change out of the dress, turns and
        looks at Jerry)

        George: Demi? I thought it was Demi?

        Jerry: No. I think it's Demi.

        George: Really? I never heard of a semi tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods
        in agreement)

        (Elaine walks back in, still in the dress)

        Elaine: Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going
        on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their
        respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them 
        --
        they recoil with surprise)

        Jerry: What?

        Elaine: Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you
        look, like, 10 pounds lighter.

        Jerry: Oh, you're crazy.

        Elaine: Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this
        dress if I looked like this at Barneys?

        George: (to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she
        might have something there.

        (Kramer enters, seeing Elaine -- his head and upper body lurches
        backwards)

        Kramer: Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?

        Elaine: Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.

        Kramer: Good idea.

        Jerry: Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.

        Elaine: Yeah yeah, ok.

        Kramer: Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some
        of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.

        Elaine: Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.

        Kramer: No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale 
        right.

        Elaine: yeah.

        Kramer: Ill meetcha down there, well have lunch.

        Elaine: Well we could ...

        Kramer: Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend 
        any
        time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks
        and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into
        the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in
        sort of disbelief)



        New scene.
        Daylight exterior shot of Yankee Stadium, then to George Costanzas
        office, he stands in front of a wall calendar, as Ade, his new secretary
        takes down notes as to what George is saying.

        George: And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah,
        play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.

        Ade: Anaheim Hotel. (George picks up a container of chinese food from
        the credenza) You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have
        room service until 10 P.M. and then it's only finger foods.

        George: Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)

        Ade: OK, now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the
        switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will
        only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable.

        George: Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ...
        efficient.

        Ade: Well thank you, Im flattered.

        George: I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.

        Ade: Well Im just, hm, doing my job.

        George: It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers)
        one step ahead of me.

        Ade: What can I say? Im ... Im good at what I do. (smiling 
        and
        quietly laughing proudly)

        George: (coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the
        chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ...
        thinking about now?

        Ade: (thinking about the question, she stops writing) Yes, I think I
        do. (she turns her head slowly and looks directly at him)

        George: Is it, uh, doable?

        Ade: It's definitely doable.

        (Ade throws her note pad and pencil in to the air, along with her
        glasses. George grabs his glasses and takes them from his face and
        throws them on the couch as he and Ade embrace in a frantic kiss and
        slither down to the floor between the desk and the couch -- the camera
        cannot see them on the floor)



        New scene.
        Outside a movie theater (The Paragon) Jerry and Elaine have exited the
        theater and are walking slowly and then stop to talk, as other movie
        goers leave the theater behind them - in the background, there is a line
        of people waiting to buy tickets for the next show.

        Jerry: Well, that was the worst.

        Elaine: I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on
        gloves) Gimme a break.

        Man: (waiting in line for tickets, he overhears Elaine) Hey, give us a
        break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth!

        Another man: (waiting in line, closer to the box office) Yeah! (in
        agreement with the other guy)

        (Kramer rushes up to Elaine and Jerry)

        Kramer: You got a pen?

        Jerry: Yeah, I think I do.

        Kramer: And I need something to write on.

        Jerry: Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.

        Kramer: I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number.
        Uma Jerry, Uma.

        Jerry: Uma Therman? Really?

        Kramer: Yeah.


        Elaine: How'd you manage that.

        Kramer: Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back
        into the theater)

        Jerry: He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry
        notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?

        Elaine: Where?

        Jerry: He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my
        Hounds-Tooth jacket.

        Elaine: What would he be doing wearing your jacket?

        Jerry: It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned.
        He complimented me on it.

        Elaine: Are you sure?

        (Kramer walks up, smiling gleefully)

        Kramer: I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)

        Elaine: You are amazing.

        Kramer: Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)



        New scene.
        Exterior shot of Yankee Stadium at dusk and then to George Costanzas
        office. [moaning] George and Ade are struggling to kneel and undress
        while kissing.

        Ade: Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo
        the jacket, then go around the back of the shirt.

        George: Ade you are incredible

        (as he unbuttons her jacket, they fall to the floor again -- the camera
        cannot see them between the desk and the couch -- we see over George's
        desk, keyboard, manila folders and then we see Ades shoe in the 
        air
        above the desk)

        Ade: Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here, I want to show you something. Hand me
        that pillow.

        (we see George's head and arm above the desk ridge, he grabs a pillow
        from the couch and hands it to Ade. Her arm pulls him back down to her
        on the ground)

        George: What? Oh, My God!

        Ade: Mr. CO STAN ZA!

        George: Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!




        New scene.
        Exterior shot of the restaurant (Monks) then inside. George and Jerry
        are sitting in the normal booth.

        Jerry: So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out
        Im giving you a raise.

        George: Yeah.

        Jerry: Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give
        raises?

        George: Not that Im aware of, no.

        Jerry: So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out
        anything that comes into your head.

        George: I didnt think ahead.

        Jerry: Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.

        George: I didnt say any other bawdy things.

        Jerry: Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.

        George: All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't
        know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.

        (they stand up from their seats at the booth)

        Jerry: All right, all right. Im sorry.

        George: Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George
        Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.

        Jerry: How long has she been there?

        George: 3 days.

        Jerry: It's almost a week.

        (Jerry picks up several items of clothing from the booth, in their
        dry-cleaning bags -- He is wearing his Hounds-Tooth jacket. George and
        Jerry walk over to the cash register to pay for lunch. At the register,
        Jerry reaches into his Hounds-Tooth jacket pocket, he pulls out a movie
        stub)

        Jerry: Oh, My god.

        George: What?

        Jerry: It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show. George, I think Willie the
        dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.



        Commercial



        New scene.
        Exterior shot of Barneys department store, street scene with store
        windows. Then inside to Elaine, Kramer and the Barneys sales
        associate -- they stand in the women's clothing dept. (Zelda is the name
        of the clothing line on the wall), outside of the dressing room area.
        Elaine is wearing the dress she plans on returning.

        Elaine: These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ...
        reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever,
        would be very interested to know what's going on here.

        Barneys sales associate: Well, we're more than happy to exchange 
        it for
        something else.

        Elaine: OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number
        right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the
        direction of the elevator)

        Barneys sales associate: Ill bring it to your dressing room.

        Elaine: Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and 
        walks
        away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What
        are you all dressed up for?

        Kramer: Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't
        want to skip on the, swank.

        Elaine: I like your little bag.

        Kramer: Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the
        bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.

        Elaine: Huh.

        (Kramer opens the moisturizer and squeezes some onto his palm)

        Kramer: Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.

        (Elaine walks away into the dressing from area. Kenny Bania enters the
        clothing dept.)

        Bania: Hey Kramer.

        Kramer: Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror,
        is putting moisturizer under his eyes)

        Bania: Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like.
        That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit)

        Kramer: Well, thank you.

        Bania: Did you get that here?

        Kramer: No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.

        Bania: You're telling me.

        Kramer: I sure am.

        Bania: It's hard for me to find pants that --

        Kramer: (interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.

        Bania: Yes

        Kramer: Me too.

        Bania: What size are you?

        Kramer: Uh, 42.

        Bania: 42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge.
        How'd you like to sell it?

        Kramer: make me an offer.


        Bania: 100 Bucks

        Kramer: Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania)

        Bania: 175

        Kramer: Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This
        is old world craftsmanship.

        Bania: 300 dollars.

        Kramer: Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.

        Bania: You throw the shirt in?

        Kramer: Bania, you're killing me.

        Bania: Hey that's the women's dressing room.

        Kramer: There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.




        New scene.
        Daylight exterior shot of Yankee Stadium (Louisville Slugger) then to
        George Steinbrenners office. The camera is behind Steinbrenner,
        looking towards the door.

        George: (Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr.
        Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?

        Steinbrenner: Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of
        course you can -- Im a very accessible man. I just wanted to say
        you're doing great work on that Canola oil stuff.

        George: Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade,
        came up with that one.

        Steinbrenner: Ade, Ade, I like that name George.

        George: She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)

        Steinbrenner: Is that a fact George?

        George: Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's
        some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards
        Steinbrenners desk)

        Steinbrenner: I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right
        on my ass.

        George: She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating 
        in
        a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.

        Steinbrenner: What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter? ($2.25)

        George: You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a
        raise.

        (Telephone rings -- Steinbrenner reaches for the receiver)

        Steinbrenner: You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home
        and bringing it in. (picks up the telephone hand set) Hello, ah, George
        will you excuse me.



        New scene.
        Daylight exterior shot of Barneys department store windows, with
        traffic driving by -- then to Elaine in the dressing room -- she is
        almost done dressing in the Calvin Klein dress.
        Kramer climbs up the wall of his dressing room adjacent to Elaine's --
        we see his head, top of his bare chest, arm and both hands over the top
        of Elaine's dressing room wall -- he is looking down at her.

        Kramer: Psst. Hey.

        (Elaine is startled and tries to cover her top, which is mostly covered
        from the dress she is putting on)

        Elaine: Kramer, what are you doing here?

        Kramer: Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.

        Elaine: What?

        Kramer: Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.

        Elaine: So go buy a new one.

        Kramer: What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.

        Elaine: So.

        Kramer: Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me
        some clothes.

        Elaine: Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens
        the dressing room door)



        New scene.
        Exterior shot of the Dry Cleaners store front, then to the interior --
        Jerry enters as a female customer is leaving the counter with her
        dry-cleaning .

        Jerry: Hello, Willie.

        Willie: Hey, Jerry. You dropping off?

        Jerry: No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?

        Willie: You came by to ask that?

        Jerry: Yeah. Specifically 9:30 shows. Seen any good 9:30 shows at the
        Paragon, Willie?

        Willie: What are you gettin at?

        Jerry: I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth
        jacket.

        Willie: Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaners code.

        Jerry: You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes

        Willie: I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things.
        (he makes the circular motion next to his ears - the international
        symbol for insane)

        Jerry: Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and
        holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws
        the stub on the counter)

        Willie: Jerry.

        Jerry: Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill 
        be
        taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.

        Willie: Jerry, come on.

        Jerry: Now.

        Willie: Now? (Willie looks off with his eyes to his left -- he is
        thinking about his wife Donna)

        (Shot of Donna wearing the fur coat, standing at a hot dog stand, eating
        a hot dog)

        Jerry: Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for
        the dry-cleaning ticket)

        Willie: Well ... ahh. (apprehensively)

        Jerry: Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer.

        Willie: Wait, you, you mean to tell me you don't have a ticket for the
        coat?

        Jerry: No, not on me.

        Willie: Well, I, I need to see that ticket.

        Jerry: Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.

        Willie: Yeah, but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are
        huge. You cant, get anything without a number.

        Jerry: All right, Ill be back.



        New scene.
        Elaine inside Barneys, she stands in front of a full length mirror.
        The sales associate behind her, giving advice on the dress.

        Elaine: Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?

        Barneys sales associate: So, uh, do you want it?

        Elaine: I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate
        walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.

        (Elaine looks around, like she is trying not to be noticed and walks out
        of the clothing dept.)




        New scene.
        Daytime exterior of Yankee Stadium, then inside to George Costanzas
        office.

        Ade: I cant thank you enough, Mr. Costanza. Im so grateful

        George: Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you

        have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if
        you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in 
        a
        circular motion to his right)

        Ade: It was just so generous.

        George: Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money.
        (spins his chair away from her)

        Ade: Oh I know, but Twenty Five Thousand.

        George: (spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year
        raise.

        Ade: Yes, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner...

        George: You're making more than I am.

        Ade: I am?

        George: What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary
        cannot make more than her boss.

        Ade: Well apparently they can.



        New scene.
        Elaine, in the Calvin Klein dress, is walking outside along the
        sidewalk, snow along the curb and store fronts -- It's obvious she is
        cold without a coat. She checks out her reflection in a florist's
        window, then stops at the Love, Health & Beauty Aids store, where 
        the
        reflection is more like a mirror in the alcove of the store.

        Elaine: Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips
        are not that large)

        (a man exits the store)

        Elaine: Hey, what do you think of this?

        Man: (with disbelief): You'll never pull it off.



        New scene.
        Barneys Department store, inside the dressing room area, a customer
        knocks on the door where Kramer is waiting for Jerry.

        Female customer: Hey, what's going on in there?

        (Jerry enters the women's clothing dept.)

        Jerry: (to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell 
        me
        where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?

        (Female customer walks up to the Barneys sales associate that Jerry 
        was
        just talking to)

        Female customer: This woman has been in there for over an hour.

        (The Barneys sales associate walks into the dressing room area and 
        up
        to the dressing room door where Kramer is waiting for Jerry)

        Barneys sales associate: Excuse me Miss., Is everything ok in there?

        Kramer: [Yeah] (through the door)

        (Jerry hears Kramer and walks into the dressing room door)

        Jerry: Kramer?

        Kramer: Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?

        Jerry: What clothes?

        Kramer: Didnt Elaine call you?

        Jerry: No.

        Kramer: Well what are you doing here?

        Jerry: What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I
        need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.

        Kramer: Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants

        Jerry: Where are your pants?

        Kramer: Well, I sold them to Bania.

        Jerry: What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.

        (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room. Kramer is
        standing there in his white boxer shorts and no shirt)

        Jerry: Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?

        Kramer: ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. 
        I
        lost Umas number.

        Jerry: Where are your clothes?

        Kramer: I told you I sold them to Bania.

        Jerry: You mean what you were wearing?

        Kramer: Yeah.

        Jerry: How'd you expect to get out of here?

        Kramer: Well, I didnt think ahead.


        (Elaine reenters the Barneys clothing dept., rubbing her arms because
        he is cold. The sales associate is also coming back from the dressing
        rooms. Elaine sees her, and quickly stands next to the register counter
        and tries to act like she has been there for a while.)

        Elaine: This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me
        something else.

        Barneys sales associate: No.

        Elaine: No?

        Barneys sales associate: No, because you're taking that one.

        Elaine: I am?

        Barneys sales associate: Yes. Because you wore it out of the store.

        Elaine: Ha! That's preposterous.

        Barneys sales associate: I suppose that salt stain came from all 
        the
        snow in the store.

        (Elaine looks down and gathers the dress at the salt stain)

        Barneys sales associate: Shall I wrap it or will you wear it out?

        Elaine: No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and
        her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area)
        Kramer, are you still in there?

        Jerry: [Elaine]

        Elaine: Jerry?

        (Bania enters the dressing room area)

        Bania: Elaine, where's Kramer?

        Kramer: Bania?

        Bania: Kramer.

        Jerry: Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer
        remains inside)

        Bania: Jerry.

        Jerry: Bania.

        Bania: Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy
        cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.

        Kramer: Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the
        door) Jerry, come back in here.

        Jerry: (to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)

        Kramer: Umas number is on that ticket.

        Jerry: Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat
        back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?

        Kramer: Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer
        cream all over it.

        Jerry: I got an idea.

        Kramer: What?

        Jerry: I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door 
        and
        exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)

        Jerry: Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?

        Bania: Pretty good.

        Jerry: Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward

        position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two
        guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those
        pants.

        Bania: Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back,
        and you'll get your ticket.

        Jerry: Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania
        -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice
        dinner.

        Bania: Can we go back to Mendys?

        Jerry: You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.

        Bania: Twice? I wanna go twice.

        Jerry: all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you 
        out for a
        nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think
        it's a pretty good deal.

        Bania: Two Mendys.

        Jerry: . . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.

        Bania: Here you go.

        Jerry: Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)



        New scene.
        Exterior of yankee Stadium (Louisville Slugger) then to George
        Steinbrenners office. George Costanza stands pleading his case.

        George: But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job
        properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I
        am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.

        Steinbrenner: Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know
        what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in
        Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a
        bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in
        the back of one of those babies.

        (George starts to back away from the desk)

        Steinbrenner: I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well
        not that I was ever one for the sweets.

        (George turning around, nodding and making hand gestures, walking slowly
        towards the door, his hand gestures get progressively wider eventually
        to full arms extended upwards)

        Steinbrenner: Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody
        else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside,
        it's a surprise. That's good, plus the chocolate ones are good too.
        Sometimes I just cant even make up my mind. A lot of times Ill 
        mix
        the two together, make a vanilla fudge.



        New scene.
        Jerry stands outside the Barneys dressing room door that Kramer 
        is
        waiting in. Jerry quickly knocks on the door.

        Jerry: Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the
        dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands
        Kramer the ticket)

        Kramer: (closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket,
        flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The
        moisturizer smudged out the phone number.

        Jerry: (Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The
        dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.

        Kramer: (grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must
        have been the botanical extracts.

        Jerry: (grabs the ticket back) Give me that.

        (Jerry Opens the door and walks into the clothing dept., while Bania is
        walking towards the exit of the clothing dept.)

        Jerry: Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers
        are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)

        Bania: (looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying
        to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.

        Jerry: The ticket is worthless.

        Bania: You promised me.

        (Jerry makes a smudged up face -- he knows he cannot get out of the
        deal. Bania turns and walks quickly out of the clothing department.
        Jerry sees a woman from the back walking into the dressing room area.
        She has a fur coat on and is carrying a few items over her arm to try
        on)

        Jerry: Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?

        (Elaine stands at the register counter, now she wears her own clothes.
        The Calvin Klein dress rests across the counter -- she watches as Jerry
        follows the woman into the dressing room area. Jerry stands in front of
        the door where she went into, listens for a half second and then pushes
        the door open, as she has not had an opportunity to latch it yet -- It
        is Donna, the dry-cleaners wife -- she is stunned, startled and taken
        aback ...)

        Donna: No it's not. (the coat)

        Jerry: It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes
        the door) Give me that back.

        Donna: No, what are you talking about.

        (The camera pans down to the bottom of the dressing room door, so all
        you see is Jerry and Donna's scuffling feet and lower legs, as Jerry
        takes the coat from her.)

        Donna: Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...

        Jerry: You cant have that coat, it's not yours.

        (Donna opens the door -- the camera pans back up to eye level as she
        walks out, kind of indignant. She places her long purse strap over her
        Left shoulder)

        Jerry: What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!

        (Donna walks over to where Elaine is still standing at the register
        counter)

        ** Continuity Error -- as she walks up to Elaine, Donna is now holding
        her long purse strap in her right hand only, then switches it to her
        left hand and puts the strap over her left shoulder. The purse hangs
        below her left hip. She just had placed the long purse strap over her
        shoulder as she left the dressing room area walking away from Jerry. **

        Elaine: Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
        (Holding the bottom of the Calvin Klein dress out)

        Donna: Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it
        in. (Holding the dress up by the hanger) What size is it?

        Elaine: (Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
        Donna's question)


        New scene.
        The camera fades from the previous scene to the winter sidewalk outside.

        L-R Kramer, Elaine and Jerry walk silently in the cold. Above their
        heads in the background is a sign that reads KalSigns -- I 
        believe
        this is an homage to Jerry's (real life) father that owned a sign
        company.

        Kramer is wearing Jerry's mother's fur coat. It is obviously too small
        for his large frame -- the arms are way too short. The coat comes down
        to his mid thigh. He has no pants on. He wears shoes and white socks.
        He looks ridiculous, uncomfortable and cold.

        Elaine is wearing a long winter overcoat, carrying her Calvin Klein
        dress in a garment bag over her left arm. Jerry has both hands in the
        pockets of his winter jacket he is wearing a scarf that he had on
        earlier in the store.

        Kramer looks around as he walks along. He tries to button or close up
        the coat to the best of his ability, but nothing changes. As the scene
        ends, the fur coat opens slightly at the bottom and you can see his
        white boxer shorts (actually they look like jockey shorts, but earlier
        he had on boxers in the dressing room)



        New scene.
        The camera fades from the previous scene to an exterior shot of Mendys
        Restaurant at dusk, then inside to Bania and Jerry dining at a table.

        Bania: Mmm. This soup is great.

        Jerry: Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly)

        Bania: I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, 
        the
        best. Are you enjoying it?

        Jerry: Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)

        Bania: Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was
        thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or
        should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the
        one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --


        Jerry: (Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but
        it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be
        different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.

        Bania: Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. 
        Im
        meeting a woman for a drink.

        Jerry: Oh, and who might that be?

        Bania: Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before
        it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the
        air)


        New scene: Final monologue -- Jerry on stage.

        Jerry: If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im
        telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't
        want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate 
        the
        specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on
        the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if
        anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions
        of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then
        sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.


    
                    Opening monologue.

                    Loyalty to any one sports team is pretty hard to justify.  Because the 
                    players
                    are always changing, the team can move to another city, you're actually rooting
                    for the clothes when you get right down to it.  You know what I mean, you 
                    are
                    standing and cheering and yelling for your clothes to beat the clothes from
                    another city.  Fans will be so in love with a player but if he goes to 
                    another
                    team, they boo him.  This is the same human being in a different shirt, 
                    they
                    *hate* him now.  Boo!  different shirt!!  Boo.


                    Opening scene.
                    Jerry and George are at a hot dog vendor's cart.

                    Jerry:  You sure you don't want the tickets?

                    George:  No thanks.

                    Jerry:  I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.

                    George:  I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.

                    Jerry:  I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.

                    George:  Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?

                    Jerry:  Maybe he didn't know?

                    George:  Lemme see.  I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking 
                    at the
                    tickets)  Row F?!

                    Jerry:  Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.

                    George:  Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?

                    Jerry:  I asked.  Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in 
                    Canadian
                    football.

                    George:  Wish I could help you.

                    Jerry:  Come on, take them.  You could take Bonnie.

                    George:  You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?

                    Jerry:  What do you think?

                    George:  So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. 
                    This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars.  Plus, she'd ask about the 
                    sleeping
                    arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.

                    Jerry:  Yeah, sleeping arrangements.  So, you haven't, uh...

                    George:   Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet.  
                    Tomorrow night's
                    the first night.

                    Jerry:  Aah.

                    George:  Hey, is that Tim Whatley?

                    Jerry:  The Dentist?

                    George:  Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?

                    Jerry:  Oh, no.  I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with 
                    it.

                    George:  Oh good.

                    Jerry:  Yeah, I blamed it on you.  Hi Tim.

                    Tim:  Hey Jerry!  George.  What are you up to?

                    Jerry:  Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.

                    George:  I'm getting a makeover.

                    Jerry:  Hey.  How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?

                    Tim:  What, are you kidding?

                    Jerry:  Here.  Two tickets.  Have a good time.

                    Tim:  How can I think you?  I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner
                    sometime.  You ever been to Mendys?

                    Jerry:  No no no.  No dinner.


                    New scene.
                    Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.

                    Jerry:  Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift.  I know, 
                    it's a label
                    maker.  The Label Baby Junior.  Yeah, I hear they're good.  Well, 
                    label me
                    thankful.  Okay, well you enjoy those tickets.  Buh-bye.

                    Jerry hangs up, there's a pounding on the door.

                    Jerry:  Come in.

                    More pounding.  Jerry opens the door and Kramer backs in carrying a board 
                    game.

                    Kramer:  Where can I put this?

                    Jerry:  What is it?

                    Kramer:  It's Risk, Jerry.  The game of world conquest. (brushing 
                    newspapers off
                    the table with his foot and setting the game board down)  Alright, that's
                    perfect.

                    Newman walks in.

                    Jerry:  Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman)  Hello, Newman.

                    Newman:  Hello, Jerry.  Will he take it?  I gotta go to work.

                    Jerry:  Take what?

                    Kramer:  The board, Jerry.  We've been playing at Newman's for six 
                    hours but
                    he's gotta go.

                    Jerry:  So why don't you leave it at Newman's?

                    Newman:  I wanted to, he won't let me.

                    Kramer:  We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will 
                    tamper
                    with it.

                    Jerry:  So that's here?

                    Kramer:  Yes, yes.  You're like Switzerland.

                    Jerry:  I don't wanna be Switzerland.


                    Kramer:  Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world
                    domination.  It's winner take all.  People cannot be trusted.

                    Newman:  Don't look at me.

                    Kramer:  Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.

                    Jerry:  Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.

                    Kramer:  Alright, so you're gonna look after it?

                    Jerry:  Yeah, yeah.

                    Kramer:  Stay strong buddy.

                    Jerry:  Yeah.

                    Kramer: Watch it good.

                    Jerry:  Ok.

                    Kramer leaves, Elaine enters.

                    Elaine:  Hey.

                    Jerry:  Hey.

                    Elaine:  Hey.  Oh, is that a label maker?

                    Jerry:  Yes it is.  I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.

                    Elaine:  Love the Label Baby, baby.  You know those things make great 
                    gifts, I
                    just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.

                    Jerry:  Tim Whatley?

                    Elaine:  Yeah.  Who sent you that one?

                    Jerry:  One Tim Whatley!

                    Elaine.  No, my Tim Whatley?

                    Jerry:  The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.

                    Elaine:  I think this is the same one I gave him.  He recycled this 
                    gift.  He's
                    a regifter!

                    Jerry:  Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same
                    thing.  Perhaps it's an homage.

                    Elaine:  Yeah, perhaps.

                    Jerry:  Well how did he react when you gave it to him?

                    Elaine:  Um, he said, "Oh.  A label maker.  Howbout that?"

                    Jerry:  He repeated the name of the gift?

                    Elaine:  Yeah, so?

                    Jerry:  Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly 
                    like
                    it.

                    Elaine:  What do you mean?

                    Jerry:  Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, 
                    "Oh. 
                    Tube socks."  What are you gonna do about it?

                    Elaine:  I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment 
                    and see
                    if he's got a label maker.

                    Jerry:  Why'd you get him a gift anyway?

                    Elaine:  Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so 
                    I thought
                    I'd get him a Christmas present.

                    Jerry:  Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm 
                    a
                    large.


                    New scene.
                    George and his girlfriend, Bonnie, are entering her apartment.

                    Bonnie:  Well, here we are.  This is the place.

                    George:  Wow.

                    Bonnie:  Do you like it?

                    George:  I love it!  This is fantastic!  Look at this couch, 
                    is this velvet?!

                    Bonnie:  Are you a velvet fan?

                    George:  A fan?  I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially 
                    acceptable. 
                    And look at this, hardwood floors!

                    Bonnie:  Aren't they great? (sees a man enter from the bedroom)  Oh, 
                    Scott, hi. 
                    This is George.  George, this is Scott, my roommate.

                    Scott walks into the kitchen.

                    George (bewildered):  Heh heh.

                    Bonnie:  Here, check out this view.  If you lean out this window, 
                    you can see
                    the river.

                    Scott returns from the kitchen eating an apple, and heads back to the bedroom.

                    George:  So Scott's your roommate, huh?

                    Bonnie:  Yes.  Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him.

                    George:  No, you didn't mention it.

                    Bonnie:  He's a great guy, you'll really like him.

                    George:  I'm sure I will.


                    New scene.
                    George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.

                    Jerry:  Male roommate, huh?

                    George:  Yes.  A male roommate.

                    Jerry:  Is this a problem?

                    George:  It's a huge problem, Jerry.  The hardest part about having 
                    sex with a
                    woman is getting her to come back to your place!  He's already got that.

                    Jerry:  Well, maybe he's --

                    George:  No.  Believe me, he's not.

                    Jerry:  So he's an eligible receiver.

                    George:  She's confiding in him about our dates.  You always like 
                    the person you
                    talk to about the date more than the date!  It's just a matter of time 
                    till they
                    realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'

                    Jerry:  What's stopping them?

                    George:  Exactly!  You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? 
                    They just put them in the same cage.

                    Jerry:  What does he look like?

                    George:  Oh, that's the worst part of it.  He looks just like me.

                    Jerry:  He looks like you and he's working from the inside?

                    George:  I look like me and I'm working from the outside.  Who do 
                    you think is
                    in the better position?

                    Jerry:  Not you.

                    George:  Ho ho.  This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!

                    Jerry:  We'll take a check please.

                    George: I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment.  It's 
                    so
                    cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet.  You know, if it were socially acceptable--

                    Jerry:  I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.

                    George:  I've said that before?

                    Jerry:  Many times.  You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, 
                    everything
                    with the velvet.

                    Kramer (entering):  Hey.

                    George:  Hey.

                    Jerry:  Hey.

                    Kramer:  Guess what?  I saw Newman talking to the super.

                    Jerry:  So what?

                    Kramer:  The super has keys to your apartment.  Don't you see what's 

                    going on? 
                    Newman is planning a sneak attack.

                    Jerry:  Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.

                    Kramer:  Yeah, alright, fine.  You sit there and you watch while Newman 
                    takes
                    over the world.  But he'd be a horrible leader.  And you know who's 
                    gonna
                    suffer?  The little people; you and George.

                    Jerry:  Are you through?

                    Kramer:  Oh.  I talked to Arthur Jobanian.  Yeah, the Drake's 
                    wedding?  That's
                    off.

                    Jerry:  The wedding is off?  What happened?

                    Kramer:  The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as 
                    the
                    Super Bowl.  So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and 
                    *phlf*
                    it's over.


                    New scene.
                    Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.

                    George:  The wedding is off.  Now you can go to the Super Bowl.

                    Jerry:  I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.

                    George:  You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a 
                    grace
                    period.

                    Jerry:  Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving?  
                    There's no
                    grace period.

                    George:  Well, didn't he regift the label maker?

                    Jerry:  Possibly.

                    George:  Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?

                    Jerry:  You may have a point.

                    George:  I have a point, I have a point.

                    Jerry:  Alright, I'll call him.

                    George:  Yeah.  What's that?

                    Jerry:  Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by 
                    two guys
                    who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials)  Hello Tim? 
                    Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you?  Well 
                    it turns
                    out I can use them.  Oh, you do?  I understand.  Okay.  
                    Bye.  He already made
                    plans, he can't change them.

                    George (eating a pickle):  Well they're his tickets, he can do what he 
                    wants
                    with them.

                    Jerry:  Thanks.

                    George:  Alright, I gotta go.  I'm heading over to Bonnie's.

                    Jerry:  What are you gonna do about the roommate?

                    George:  I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him.  It's 
                    like a
                    Sigfried and Roy trick.

                    Jerry:  Well, the pickle breath is a good start.

                    George leaves, Newman enters, or would except Jerry tries slamming the door 
                    on
                    him.

                    Newman:  Hello Jerry, may I come in?

                    Jerry:  What do you want?

                    Newman (squeezing himself through the narrow space):  Nothing, just being
                    neighborly.  Do you wanna hang out?  Shoot the breeze?

                    Jerry:  I'm not letting you cheat, Newman.  You're not getting anywhere 
                    near
                    that board.

                    Newman:  Jerry?  I'm a little insulted.

                    Jerry:  You're not a little anything, Newman.  So just pack it up 
                    and move it
                    out of here.

                    Newman (leaving):  Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?

                    Jerry:  I dunno, watch it on TV I guess.  Why?

                    Newman:  Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me.  
                    I'll be the
                    one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.

                    Jerry:  You're going to the Super Bowl?

                    Newman:  Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets 
                    and he
                    offered one to me.

                    Jerry:  What's his name?

                    Newman:  Tim Whatley.

                    Jerry:  That's my ticket!

                    Newman:  Is it?!  Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved 
                    some time
                    and given it directly to me!  Ha ha ha.

                    Jerry (as Newman leaves):  Newman!

                    George:  What a movie.  Good choice.

                    Bonnie:  Thank Scott.  He recommended it.

                    George:  Oh, Scott, Scott.  He's really great, isn't he?

                    Bonnie:  Yes he is.

                    George:  Yes he is.  Let me ask you something.  When you come 
                    out of the shower
                    and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about
                    that?

                    Bonnie:  George?

                    George:  Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting 
                    it
                    flap in the breeze?

                    Bonnie:  George, you're being ridiculous.

                    George:  What's the massage situation?

                    Bonnie:  What do you mean?

                    George:  Is there any work being done?  Is there any rubbing, touching, 
                    finger
                    manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?

                    Bonnie:  George, would you just stop?

                    George:  Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's 
                    the
                    outfit?  I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?

                    Bonnie:  George, what is wrong with you?

                    George:  I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate!  
                    It's
                    unnatural, it's an abomination!

                    Scott enters.

                    Scott:  Hey!

                    George:  Hey!

                    Scott:  How ya going?

                    George:  I'm good.

                    Scott (to Bonnie): Are you gonna need the bathroom?  'Cause I'm gonna jump 
                    in
                    the shower.

                    Bonnie:  No, just throw my bras out of the way.

                    Elaine:  Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?

                    Tim:  Upstairs?  You wanna go upstairs?

                    Elaine:  I would love to go upstairs.

                    Tim:  Elaine, you are something else.  No one can ever put a label 
                    on you, huh?

                    Elaine:  We'll see.

                    Jerry:  Newman.  He's going with Newman.

                    George:  How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?

                    Jerry:  Newman's his mailman.

                    George:  Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!

                    Jerry:  Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!

                    George:  Well, he's merry.

                    Jerry:  He is merry, I'll give him that.  (notices a cactus on the 
                    table) 
                    What's this plant for?

                    George:  I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.

                    Jerry:  Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.

                    Elaine enters.

                    Elaine:  Hey, guess what?  I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.

                    Jerry:  What?

                    Elaine:  We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.

                    Jerry:  What about the label maker?

                    Elaine:  Ah, well.

                    Jerry:  Wait a minute, that's my ticket!  You didn't even want to 
                    go.

                    Elaine:  It was totally out of the blue.  We went upstairs to his 
                    apartment, you
                    know, to look for the label maker.

                    Jerry:  So, how did you get up there?  Did you say you had to use 
                    the bathroom?

                    Elaine:  No.

                    Jerry:  Then how'd you get up there?

                    Elaine:  I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"

                    George:  And there's you ticket.

                    Elaine:  What?

                    Jerry:  That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.

                    Elaine:  Why?

                    Jerry:  You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like 
                    you're
                    Mae West?  Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.

                    Elaine:  You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's 
                    going
                    downtown?

                    Jerry:  Obviously.

                    Elaine:  You're crazy.

                    George:  Well, what happened when you got upstairs?

                    Elaine:  As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients 
                    with an
                    impacted molar or something so he had to leave.  I didn't even get a chance 
                    to
                    look for the label maker.

                    Jerry:  Yeah, well I don't trust this guy.  I think he regifted, he 
                    degifted,
                    and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.


                    New scene.
                    Jerry is in the hallway approaching his apartment door.  Kramer walks out 
                    of his
                    apartment.

                    Kramer:  Hey.

                    Jerry:  Hey.  What are you doing?

                    Kramer:  I'm watching your door.

                    Jerry:  My door?

                    Kramer:   Yeah, from my peephole.  Fisheye, sees all.

                    Cut to the interior of Jerry's apartment.  Newman sneaks out from the bedroom
                    towards the table where the Risk board is sitting.  He accidentally knocks 
                    some
                    CDs off the shelving unit, making a lot of noise.

                    Jerry (still outside):  What was that?

                    Kramer:  Newman!

                    Jerry begins opening the door, Newman does not have enough time to change the
                    board pieces.

                    Newman (fleeing to the bedroom):  Damn!

                    Jerry (after entering):  The bedroom!

                    Jerry runs to the bedroom, catching a glimpse of Newman climbing out the open
                    window and up the fire escape.  Jerry and Kramer rush to the window.

                    Jerry:  I see you, Newman!  I see you!

                    Kramer:  I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!

                    Tim:  Oh?  What's that?

                    Elaine:  I've got Super Bowl fever.

                    Tim:  Oh yeah, me too.

                    Elaine:  So where are we staying?

                    Tim:  Oh, the Ambassador.

                    Elaine:  Oh.  Big room?

                    Tim:  It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.

                    Elaine:  Downtown?

                    Tim:  Right downtown.

                    Elaine:  What do they have there, a couple of beds?

                    Tim:  Why?  You bringing someone else?

                    Elaine:  No, but don't you think there should be two beds?  There's 
                    two of us.

                    Tim's grin disappears.

                    to the
bathroom.

                    They share a laugh.  Scott enters from the back holding a cardboard box.  
                    He
                    places it on a stack of similar boxes.

                    Scott:  Well, look who's here.

                    Jerry:  So she kicked him out of the apartment.

                    George:  That's right.  It's just me and her.

                    Jerry:  Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.


                    George:  I guess she did.  He's gone, now I'm the man.

                    Jerry:  That's not a good role for you.

                    George:  No, it's not.

                    Jerry:  You unwittingly made a major commitment.  That's a lot of 
                    pressure.

                    George:  Oh my god.

                    Jerry:  You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.

                    George:  I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the 
                    load.

                    Jerry:  He was shouldering.

                    George (walking towards the door):  I couldn't leave well enough alone?!

                    Jerry:  Where are you going?

                    George:  I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for
                    shipping.

                    Jerry:  Oh, well here.  Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to 
                    see it
                    again.

                    George:  Thanks.

                    Kramer (rolling the dice):  Yeah.  I am taking over South America 
                    and there
                    ain't nothing you can do about it.

                    Jerry:  So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?

                    Newman:  Yeah.  I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly 
                    get lost
                    in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.

                    Tim:  Hey Jerry?

                    Jerry:  Ah, Tim Whatley.  Out scalping?

                    Tim:  Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel
                    horrible.  Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.

                    Jerry:  Are you serious, what about Elaine?

                    Tim: Oh, Elaine.  Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought 
                    they
                    would.

                    Kramer's car? (yelling up)  Hey, Cosmo!!  They're towing your car!!

                    Kramer (running to the window):  What?!  Not my car!!  Hey!!  
                    They're towing my
                    car!!

                    Kramer runs out the door, leaving Newman alone with the Risk board, but only 
                    for
                    a moment.  He runs back in and grabs the board.

                    Newman:  What are you doing?

                    Kramer:  I'm taking the board with me.

                    Kramer runs out carrying the board, Newman follows a moment later.

                    Back on the street, Kramer's car is jacked up and the driver is just taking 
                    off. 
                    Kramer comes running after it, yelling at the driver and balancing the game
                    board with Newman at his heels.

                    Tim:  So, I guess I'll see you at the game.

                    Jerry:  Yeah, see you there.


                    New scene.
                    George walks into Bonnie's apartment, *everything* is boxed up and Bonnie is
                    taping up the last of the boxes.  He knocks to get her attention.

                    Bonnie:  Hi, George.

                    George:  What, what happened?  Where's, where's all the stuff?

                    Bonnie:  It's gone.  It was all his.  Is this a label maker?

                    George:  The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the 
                    velvet?

                    Bonnie:  They were his.  Besides, we don't need any of those things.  
                    We have
                    each other.


                    New scene.
                    Kramer and Newman are on a subway car, the Risk board sits on their laps.

                    Newman:  Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?

                    Kramer:  Oh, stop stalling.  Come on.

                    Newman:  I can't think, there's all this noise.

                    Kramer:  Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland?  
                    I've driven
                    you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete
                    annihilation.

                    Newman:  I'm not beaten yet.  I still have armies in the Ukraine.

                    This comment perks up the ears of what appears to be a Russian immigrant.

                    Kramer:  Ha ha, the Ukraine.  Do you know what the Ukraine is?  
                    It's a sitting
                    duck.  A road apple, Newman.  The Ukraine is weak.  It's feeble.  
                    I think it's
                    time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.

                    Ukrainian:  I come from Ukraine.  You not say Ukraine weak.

                    Kramer:  Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.

                    Ukrainian:  Ukraine is game to you?!  Howbout I take your little board 
                    and smash
                    it!!

                    The Ukrainian pounds the game board, destroying it and sending army pieces
                    flying.


                    New scene.
                    Tim Whatley approaches his building, Elaine is waiting at the door.

                    Elaine:  Hello, Tim.

                    Tim (startled):  Elaine, hi.

                    Elaine:  Don't worry, Tim.  I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't 
                    come by
                    for that at all.  I just came by to pick up my label maker.  I gave 
                    you a label
                    maker and now I would like to have it back.

                    Tim:  But you gave it to me.

                    Elaine:  But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl.  Hand it over, 
                    Whatley.

                    Tim:  Uh, ok.

                    Elaine:  You don't have the label maker, do you?

                    Tim:  Uh, no.

                    Elaine:  I knew it!  You're a regifter!

                    Tim:  Oh, yeah, some gift.  That thing didn't work at all.

                    Elaine:  What?

                    Tim:  You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel 
                    right
                    off.  It was the worst gift I ever got.

                    Elaine (visibly upset):  Well, I bought it for you because you were so 
                    nice to
                    me for not charging me for the dental work.  The way you worked on my filling,
                    you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.

                    Tim:  Oh, Elaine!

                    They embrace passionately.

                    A close-up of a box labeled with "Scott Thomas" and a street address 
                    is shown. 
                    The labels fall off the box, one by one.

                    First the exterior, then the interior of a football stadium.  Jerry is 
                    walking

                    down the aisle.

                    Jerry:  H... G... F.  Seat four.  One, two, three... f-- Hello 
                    Newman.

                    Newman:  Hello, Jerry.  Tim couldn't make it, he's in love.  
                    Isn't that
                    wonderful?

                    Jerry:  Oh, it's enchanting.


                    New scene.
                    George is bringing a portable TV to Bonnie's so they can watch the game.

                    Bonnie:  Hi.

                    George:  Here's the TV.  I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl.  
                    Do you at
                    least have some towels we could sit on?  It's, like, a four hour game.

                    Bonnie:  George, Scott's gonna drop by.  He said he never got his 
                    boxes.  I'll
                    get the towels.

                    George (internally):  How am I gonna get out of this?  Think Costanza, 
                    think!

                    Bonnie:  Here we are.

                    George:  Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.

                    Bonnie:  What is it?

                    George:  Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but 
                    I, uh, I
                    believe it's Ménage à Trois?

                    Bonnie:  What?

                    Just then, Scott enters.

                    Scott:  Hi.

                    Bonnie:  Scott!  Remember what we talked about the other day?  
                    George is into
                    it.

                    Scott:  Oh really?!

                    Scott walks towards George, the camera moves in on a close-up of an increasingly
                    horrified George, and freezes.

                    Jerry and Newman are at the Super Bowl.

                    Newman:  Great streak of luck I'm having.  First, Kramer almost beat 
                    me at Risk
                    but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.

                    Jerry:  Can you move over at all?!

                    Newman:  And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the 
                    post
                    office with no labels.  No labels, Jerry.  You know what that means?  
                    Freebies!! 
                    I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.

                    Jerry:  An inch!  Can you move over an inch?!?

              [Nightclub]

              Jerry's standup piece.

              JERRY: The big new accessory with eyeglasses, seems to be that strap, 
              that
              connects in the back so you can take 'em on and off. Which I don't 
              get, because
              I thought, if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear 
              glasses?
              'You need glasses', isn't that what they say? I mean, an eye doctor 
              doesn't say
              'Would you care for some glasses?' When people have crutches, they 
              don't have
              like a little chain attached to their belt, so they can just let 
              go of 'em every
              now and then. Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for when you're
              water-skiing, the thing could just... (mimes semi-airborne wig with 
              hand)

              [Street]

              George hurrying along, he passes Gary who recognises him.

              GARY: Hey George.

              GEORGE: Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? 
              I've been
              leaving you phone messages for months.

              GARY: I know. I've been pretty busy.

              GEORGE: Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're 
              all busy,
              everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?

              GARY: Mostly chemotherapy. 'Kay, I'll see you.

              [Different Street]

              A cop, with an eye patch, is writing a ticket for a car. Kramer 
              is about to cross
              the street. He waits for a car to pass. As it passes, a tray of 
              litter is tossed
              from its window and lands near Kramer.

              KRAMER: (to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!

              The cop hears this and turns to see who said it. As he does so, 
              the car he is
              ticketing starts up and speeds away.

              COP: (at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!

              Kramer takes advantage of the distraction to run away.

              [Jerry's Apartment]

              JERRY: So you called the cop a pig?

              KRAMER: I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. 
              You don't throw
              trash on the streets of my town.

              JERRY: Didn't you explain that to the cop?

              KRAMER: No, I fled the scene.

              George enters. He looks disquieted.

              JERRY: (to George) Hey.

              KRAMER: (to George) Hey buddy.

              GEORGE: Hey, uh...

              KRAMER: What?

              GEORGE: Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.

              KRAMER: Oh. What about?

              GEORGE: Kramer...

              KRAMER: Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?

              Kramer grabs George in a headlock.

              GEORGE: Hey, you're hurting me!

              KRAMER: You gonna share it with me next time, huh?

              GEORGE: I swear, I swear!

              KRAMER: Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.

              He releases George from the headlock and exits, but he closes the 
              door slowly
              and can be seen peering in through the decreasing gap until it finally 
              shuts
              completely. Jerry and George watch him until the door is closed.

              GEORGE: Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had 
              cancer.

              JERRY: Oh yeah, I knew.

              GEORGE: You knew? How did you know?

              JERRY: He told me a few months ago.

              GEORGE: Why did he tell you and not me?

              JERRY: I don't know.

              GEORGE: How are you closer to him than me?

              Jerry shrugs.

              GEORGE: So, is he okay?

              JERRY: Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while 
              though.

              GEORGE: Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?

              JERRY: No, he was on his regular bed.

              GEORGE: So why didn't you tell me?

              JERRY: He swore me to secrecy.

              GEORGE: So?

              JERRY: It's not like you're my wife.

              GEORGE: Well, I still think you shoulda told me.

              JERRY: Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not 
              easy to deal
              with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost 
              made myself
              sick.

              GEORGE: Well, I wanna talk to him about this.

              JERRY: That's right, you let him have it.

              GEORGE: Mmm-mm.

              JERRY: Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?

              GEORGE: That's what I'm saying.


              JERRY: His illness is your business.

              GEORGE: If not mine, whose?

              JERRY: If not now, when?

              The door opens and Elaine enters. She senses a conversation has 
              just ceased.

              ELAINE: Were you just talking about me?

              GEORGE: No, an old friend of ours, Gary.

              ELAINE: Oh, the guy with cancer?

              GEORGE: (to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!

              JERRY: If I told you, you woulda given it away.

              GEORGE: You don't think I can keep a secret?

              JERRY: No, but he would've read your face.

              GEORGE: You don't trust my poker face?

              JERRY: Do you ever win at poker?

              GEORGE: (shamefaced) No.

              Door opens and Kramer enters. He sees Elaine.

              KRAMER: Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.

              ELAINE: Egh, Jake Jarmel?

              KRAMER: Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd 
              he get those.

              ELAINE: Why? You don't wear glasses.

              KRAMER: I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.

              GEORGE: I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. 
              That's like
              me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.

              KRAMER: Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get 
              in touch with
              this guy?

              ELAINE: Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.

              KRAMER: Ah.

              ELAINE: You know, we had a really bad break-up.

              JERRY: The Jujy Fruits?

              ELAINE: (upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.

              [Waldenbooks]

              A queue of people wait to have their hardbacks signed by Jake Jarmel, 
              who sits
              at a table, wearing spectacles with dark oval frames. Kramer is 
              having his copy
              signed.

              JAKE: Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.

              KRAMER: Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those 
              eyeglass
              frames?

              JAKE: I can't tell you that.

              KRAMER: So you don't know where you got 'em?

              JAKE: Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.

              KRAMER: Well, that's peculiar. (leaves)

              [Monk's]

              George and Gary sit in a booth. Among the other customers is an 
              attractive woman
              sitting in the corner, reading a book.

              GEORGE: Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.

              GARY: Really?

              GEORGE: Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. 
              Never talks to
              anybody.

              GARY: Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi.

              GEORGE: (pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, 
              I really have
              to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide 
              in me.

              GARY: Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get 
              two pair, the
              whole table knows.

              GEORGE: Well I still think it was wrong.

              GARY: Right, well I'm sorry, all right. I guess I was just thinking 
              of myself.

              GEORGE: (well, obviously) Yes.

              [Another street]

              Kramer is talking to the eyepatch-wearing cop.

              KRAMER: ...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. 
              I wanted
              to be a policeman.

              COP: Yeah? So why didn't you?

              KRAMER: Scared of being shot.

              COP: Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine 
              I ticketed a
              brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was 
              never paid, and
              since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than 
              anyone in New
              York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give 
              me the slip
              time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's 
              become my
              'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to 
              you, I don't
              know if I'll ever get that chance again!

              KRAMER: I like that eye patch.

              [Monks']

              GEORGE: (standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's 
              up. Can't park in
              this city.

              GARY: (standing) Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work 
              for, they own
              that parking lot around the corner.

              GEORGE: Wha, that's a Kinney lot?

              GARY: Yeah, and there's a space opening up, and I could get it for 
              you. You just
              have to pay the tax on it. It'd be like, fifty a month.

              GEORGE: Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.

              GARY: All right, I got lunch, all right.

              GEORGE: You still owe me a secret.

              GARY: All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, 
              all right?

              GEORGE: Yeah?

              GARY: Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry.

              GEORGE: What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's 
              my wife.

              GARY: Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie.

              GEORGE: Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?

              GARY: Well, I (laughs) I never actually had cancer. (laughs) I'll 
              see you.
              (leaves)

              [Jerry's apartment]

              Kramer and Jerry sit on the couch, Elaine in the chair. Kramer and 
              Elaine are
              talking, Jerry reads a magazine.

              ELAINE: So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?

              KRAMER: (rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves 
              his legs)

              ELAINE: Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's 
              legs) You know,
              he has to be the only one who has 'em.

              KRAMER: Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door 
              to leave)
              Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.


              ELAINE: What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You 
              told Jake I
              said hi?

              KRAMER: Yeah.

              ELAINE: I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said 
              hi? I never
              said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?

              JERRY: I never heard her say hi.

              KRAMER: Well, it's uh, common courtesy.

              ELAINE: No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made 
              the last
              contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. 
              If he
              thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.

              JERRY: It's like a game of tag.

              Elaine gathers her stuff together, ready to leave.

              JERRY: Where you going?

              ELAINE: Nowhere.

              JERRY: You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't 
              you?

              ELAINE: So what if I do? (heads for the door)

              KRAMER: (to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going 
              there,
              (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where 
              he got
              those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!

              George enters as Kramer and Elaine leave. He closes the door behind 
              him.

              JERRY: Hey. How'd it go with Gary?

              GEORGE: (shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes 
              his coat)

              JERRY: (suspicious) Really?

              GEORGE: (shifty) Yeah.

              JERRY: You look like something's on your mind.

              GEORGE: No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)

              JERRY: So, that's your poker face.

              GEORGE: My regular face.

              JERRY: No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.

              GEORGE: What are you saying?

              JERRY: All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)

              GEORGE: I got nothing.

              JERRY: What you got, a pair of bullets?

              GEORGE: What you talking about?

              JERRY: Two pair? Three of a kind?

              GEORGE: Will you stop it?

              JERRY: Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!

              GEORGE: I don't have a flush.

              JERRY: A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, 
              I wanna see
              'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!

              GEORGE: (broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!

              [Waldenbooks]

              Jake Jarmel is at the same table as before. Elaine is talking to 
              him. There are
              other people queuing behind her.

              ELAINE: So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you 
              from me. When
              in fact it was an unauthorised hi.

              JAKE: You're saying you didn't say hi.

              ELAINE: That's what I'm saying.

              JAKE: So that's what you came down here to tell me?

              ELAINE: Correct.

              JAKE: You never said hi?

              ELAINE: Correct.

              JAKE: You still like me, don't you?

              ELAINE: Correct. (catches herself) What's that?

              MAN: Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.

              ELAINE: (takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can 
              you say that
              I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?

              JAKE: Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is 
              more of a
              gesture than if you did say hi.

              ELAINE: Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...

              [Jerry's apartment]

              GEORGE: The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed 
              he never
              actually had it.

              JERRY: So what was wrong with him?

              GEORGE: Nothing!

              JERRY: So he's been lying to me for two months?!

              GEORGE: That's right.

              JERRY: What kind of person is this? There's only one other person 
              who might be
              able to do something like this, and that's you.

              GEORGE: Well...

              JERRY: I don't even think you could do it.

              GEORGE: Oh, I could do it.

              JERRY: Yeah, I guess you could.

              GEORGE: (snorts) C'mon.

              JERRY: Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if 
              he had to get
              chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the 
              Hair Team For
              Men, just to put his mind at ease?

              GEORGE: You did that?

              JERRY: Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick 
              up phone)

              GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes 
              to take
              phone from Jerry)

              JERRY: Why not?

              GEORGE: (puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, 
              he's giving
              me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.

              JERRY: So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, 
              I gotta
              pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?

              GEORGE: Yeah.

              JERRY: Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed 
              to see
              him tomorrow.

              GEORGE: Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. 
              You can't
              start acting any differently. You have to be nice.

              JERRY: Why didn't he tell me?

              GEORGE: Because you were being so nice.

              JERRY: I don't think I can be that nice.

              GEORGE: (shouts) You be nice!

              George and Jerry turn their backs to other and angrily stalk away 
              from each
              other.

              [Monk's]


              Jerry enters. He looks around for Gary, and does a double-take as 
              he see him
              sitting in a booth, wearing a wig.

              JERRY: Gary?

              GARY: What d'you think? Check it out. (he tries a number of expressions, 
              turning
              his head side to side, to show off the hairpiece)

              JERRY: Is that from my gift certificate?

              GARY: Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been 
              so nice.
              (shakes Jerry by the hand)

              JERRY: (through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take 
              advantage.

              GARY: Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid 
              of all my
              fillings, 'cos that mercury's toxic. Hey, let me see your fillings.

              JERRY: I don't think so.

              GARY: Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look.

              Jerry can be seen struggling against his instincts. He hears George's 
              words from
              earlier.

              GEORGE (V.O.): You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) 
              parking
              space... parking space...

              Jerry leans forward and opens his mouth, but he's not happy about 
              it.

              GARY: (peering in) Well, what d'you know. Hey, lookee there, you're 
              loaded.

              JERRY: Okay. (shuts mouth)

              GARY: Hey, look who's over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out, 
              Jack! (rises)

              Kramer enters. He's wearing an eyepatch like the cop's.

              KRAMER: (to Jerry) Hey buddy.

              JERRY: Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?

              KRAMER: It's an eyepatch.

              JERRY: You look like a pirate.

              KRAMER: I wanna be a pirate.

              JERRY: (gesturing) This is Gary.

              KRAMER: (to Gary) How you doing?

              GARY: All right.

              Kramer goes to shake Gary by the hand, but due to his impaired vision, 
              he misses
              by several inches at the first attempt. He lifts the patch up to 
              restore his
              depth perception. They shake, and Gary leaves to talk to the 'girl 
              who never
              talks'. Kramer moves to sit in the vacant seat.

              KRAMER: Well, I tell you there's only one problem.

              Kramer sits down, misjudges the seat and almost slides under the 
              table. He
              upsets plates and glasses.

              JERRY: Can't see on your right side?

              KRAMER: No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy

              [George's car]

              DEBBY: Nice car.

              GEORGE: Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.

              DEBBY: So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?

              GEORGE: Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.

              DEBBY: I didn't say hi.

              GEORGE: You didn't?

              DEBBY: Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi.

              GEORGE: Regards?

              DEBBY: Yeah, regards.

              [Cab]

              ELAINE: Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell 
              him I didn't
              say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. 
              Don't you hate
              smugness?

              CABBIE: (heavy accent) Smugness is not a good quality.

              ELAINE: (looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. 
              I think he's
              wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the 
              car. (hands
              money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of 
              getting back at
              my ex-boyfriend.

              CABBIE: Good. Revenge is very good.

              [Street]

              Elaine is running after a guy who is indeed wearing identical spectacles 
              to Mr
              Jarmel.

              ELAINE: (calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up 
              to guy) Excuse
              me, sir. Sir?

              GUY: Yes?

              ELAINE: Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where 
              you got
              your glasses?

              GUY: Malaysia.

              ELAINE: Malaysia?

              GUY: Yeah.

              ELAINE: Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them 
              from you?

              GUY: Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.

              ELAINE: (positive) Oh! (little chuckle)

              GUY: But I, I can barely see without these.

              ELAINE: C'mon.

              GUY: Well, these were expensive.

              ELAINE: Let's start the bidding.

              [George's car]

              GEORGE: So, you didn't think this was a date?

              DEBBY: N... no, not really. Why, is it... a date?

              GEORGE: I thought it was a date.

              DEBBY: No. It's not a date.

              GEORGE: What about the regards?

              DEBBY: Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said 
              hi. Hey, the
              fact is... (sighs) I shouldn't say anything.

              GEORGE: No, tell me.

              DEBBY: Can you keep a secret?

              GEORGE: Me? Oh yeah.

              DEBBY: (deep breath) I never had feelings for Gary until he got 
              sick. But, h...
              he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on 
              life. I... I
              fell in love with him.

              GEORGE: Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.

              [Monk's]

              Jerry and Kramer in their booth.

              JERRY: Hey, do you know what the Whip does?

              KRAMER: What whip?

              JERRY: The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.


              KRAMER: Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't 
              vote the way
              that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds 
              imaginary
              whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be 
              big trouble.
              (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)

              Gary returns from talking to the 'girl who never talks'.

              GARY: She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word 
              to anybody.
              Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack!

              [Street]

              The eye patch-wearing cop spots a familiar Dodge.

              COP: Well, well. The 'white whale'.

              He moves in for the kill.

              [George's car]

              GEORGE: (frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park 
              around here. I
              don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.

              DEBBY: Don't complain, at least you have your health.

              [Street]

              The guy Elaine bought the glasses from is peering blurrily about. 
              It's clear he
              can barely see anything. He steps between cars and out into the 
              road.

              [George's car]

              DEBBY: George, look out for that man!

              [Monk's]

              The sound of tires squealing is heard from outside, followed immediately 
              by the
              crash of cars colliding. Kramer leaps to his feet and heads out 
              to investigate.

              [Street]

              The cop has obviously been distracted by the same noises whilst 
              writing a
              ticket. The scofflaw has taken advantage, and the Dodge squeals 
              away, passing
              Kramer as he emerges from Monk's.

              COP: (to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here!

              KRAMER: (looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!

              [Jerry's apartment]

              GEORGE: Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?

              JERRY: Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get 
              a wig? Would
              you do that?

              GEORGE: No. Definitely not.

              JERRY: Yeah.

              GEORGE: I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.

              JERRY: And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee 
              shop.

              GEORGE: The one who always sits by herself?

              JERRY: Yeah!

              GEORGE: How did he do that?

              JERRY: Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.

              GEORGE: Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him 
              because he has
              all this perspective!

              JERRY: She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, 
              so he can get
              some phony hair has perspective?

              GEORGE: (opening door to leave) He picked her up?

              JERRY: Walked right over to her table.

              GEORGE: Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes 
              the
              resulting fallout off his jacket)

              [Waldenbooks]

              Jake still at the signing table. People still queuing. Elaine skips 
              past the
              queue.

              ELAINE: Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) 
              Aaw, see,
              you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.

              JAKE: Where did you get those?

              ELAINE: Malaysia. I was in the area.

              Jake thumps the desk in frustrated rage.

              [Newman's car]

              Newman is sitting alone. The door opens and Kramer jumps in.

              NEWMAN: (surprised) Kramer.

              KRAMER: Just drive.

              Newman puts the car in gear and sets off.

              KRAMER: All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who 
              you are. You're
              the scofflaw.

              NEWMAN: (defensive) What're you talking about...

              KRAMER: (interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.

              NEWMAN: All right, so it's me. So what?

              KRAMER: You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second 
              of the day?
              Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. 
              Sitting
              alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.

              NEWMAN: I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!

              KRAMER: Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you 
              tell me?

              NEWMAN: I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.

              KRAMER: So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?

              NEWMAN: (sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. 
              (pleading)
              Help me Kramer! Help me!

              KRAMER: All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.

              [Street]

              George and Jerry, walking together.

              GEORGE: I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.

              JERRY: You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You 
              got your natural
              little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down 
              on top of
              'em.

              GEORGE: Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you 
              don't even know
              about.

              JERRY: What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell 
              her?

              GEORGE: The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell 
              her.

              JERRY: So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral 
              the
              mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought 
              you might want
              this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!

              [Monk's]

              Elaine and Mr Lippman, sitting in a booth.

              LIPPMAN: It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing 
              house, and
              if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna 
              do. If I can
              get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll 
              have
              something for you. (laughs)

              ELAINE: Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I 
              mean, you have

              no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.

              LIPPMAN: Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.

              ELAINE: Oh really, you like 'em?

              LIPPMAN: Uh huh. Very unusual.

              ELAINE: Well, you know what? (removes glasses)

              LIPPMAN: What?

              ELAINE: (hands them over) You can have 'em.

              LIPPMAN: Oh, no no no. (waves them away) Please.

              ELAINE: No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change 
              the
              prescription in an hour. Take 'em.

              LIPPMAN: Really?

              ELAINE: Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.

              LIPPMAN: (accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses.

              ELAINE: They're from Malaysia.

              LIPPMAN: (putting on spectacles) Oh yeah?

              ELAINE: (admiring gasp) Fabulous.

              [Courtroom]

              Newman stands before a female Judge. Kramer stands beside him. There 
              are the
              usual personnel for a courtroom.

              JUDGE: Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never 
              come across
              anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious
              consideration and I've decided that what's best for the city and 
              possibly for
              yourself, is for you to keep your car, in a garage...

              Newman bursts into anguished tears.

              JUDGE: ...convenient to your home.

              NEWMAN: (sobbing) I can't afford that!

              JUDGE: Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that 
              your car is
              impounded...

              Newman's sobbing reaches new heights.

              JUDGE: ...and sold at auction.

              KRAMER: Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.

              The judge peers at Kramer. She does not look impressed by this statement.

              [Hair Team For Men]

              George, Jerry and a Salesman, wearing a substandard toupee, are 
              in a fitting
              room (?). George is sitting before a mirror, trying on a wig, assisted 
              by the
              salesman, while Jerry looks on.

              GEORGE: (to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?

              JERRY: (unimpressed) I, really can't say.

              GEORGE: No, say. I want you to say.

              JERRY: It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for 
              word) stupid.
              (to salesman) I'm sorry.

              SALESMAN: You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to 
              his scalp.

              GEORGE: (examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty 
              good.

              JERRY: Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami 
              Beach and get
              the whole thing over with?

              GEORGE: (to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.

              SALESMAN: As I said, it'll be different once we design something 
              specifically
              for you. But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.

              JERRY: Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!

              SALESMAN: (getting annoyed) No, I don't think you're being helpful! 
              I think
              you're being disruptive, and you make it very difficult for your 
              friend here to
              improve his life!

              JERRY: Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of 
              those guys
              people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! 
              No offence to
              you personally!

              SALESMAN: (angry) All you people with hair think you're so damn 
              superior! You
              have no idea what it's like. You ever look down in the bottom of 
              your tub and
              see a fist fulla hair? How'd you like to start your day with that?! 
              (looks ready
              to punch Jerry)

              JERRY: All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.

              GEORGE: (leaps to feet) Jerry!

              JERRY: I'm sorry.

              GEORGE: Please. (sits again)

              The door opens and Gary enters. He's humming to himself.

              GARY: Hey Jerry, th... (spots George) George, you decided to get 
              a rug! Good for
              you, Jack!

              GEORGE: Well, I'm, I'm just looking.

              GARY: Oh. (to salesman) Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment.

              SALESMAN: I'll be right with you.

              The salesman/Tommy leaves.

              GARY: Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able 
              to give you
              that parking space.

              GEORGE: What?

              JERRY: What?

              GARY: This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you 
              can't fight
              City Hall.

              Jerry gives a questioning look to George, who responds with a 'go 
              ahead'
              expression.

              JERRY: You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat 
              with George the
              other day...

              GARY: (to George) You didn't?!

              GEORGE: (admiring himself in mirror) I did.

              JERRY: (advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes 
              indistinct)

              We see George continuing to admire himself as, off-camera, Gary 
              and Jerry are
              heard struggling for possession of Gary's wig.

              GARY: (indistinct) I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!

              JERRY: Gimme that thing!

              [Monk's]

              Typical number of customers. George enters, wearing his new toupee. 
              One or two
              of the staff give him a glance. He looks around, and taps the counter 
              by the
              cash register. A beautiful brunette sitting at the nearest table 
              give him an
              admiring look.

              GEORGE: How's your life? All right?

              WOMAN: Yeah, not bad at all.

              She pushes the chair opposite her out from the table in an invitation 
              for George
              to sit down. George looks pleasantly surprised by the beneficial 
              effects of his
              hairpiece.

              [Press conference]

              Mr Lippman and Jake Jarmel are on a small stage with a lectern. 
              In front of it

              are a group of reporters and, amongst them sits Elaine.

              LIPPMAN: (at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, 
              it is my
              pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as 
              he vacates the
              lectern in his favour)

              There is a brief ripple of applause as Jake steps up to take questions.

              REPORTER: So Jake, what's your percentage on this book?

              Several of the reporters laugh, as does Jake. Mr Lippman steps back 
              to the
              lectern. He has some notes, and is extracting his glasses from his 
              pocket.

              LIPPMAN: Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information 
              on that.
              (puts on glasses) You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...

              JAKE: (notices glasses) Where did you get those?

              LIPPMAN: ... as such, it...

              JAKE: Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?

              LIPPMAN: (confused) Where... what?

              JAKE: (to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on 
              me? Because it's
              not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) 
              I want the
              glasses! Give me those!

              He tries to pull them from Lippman's face, and a struggle ensues. 
              Jake can be
              heard demanding the glasses. The reporters endeavour to get a view 
              of the noisy
              fracas. Elaine rises and begins to make her way toward the exit. 
              She is
              apologetic to her neighbour.

              ELAINE: (mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.

        and me?

        JERRY: Well, what do you mean?

        GEORGE: Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you
        know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?

        JERRY: Well I think that's pretty obvious.

        GEORGE: Yeah. Me too.

        GEORGE: Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)

        JERRY: Why?

        ELAINE: George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)

        JERRY: Really? What would you do?

        GEORGE: Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he
        opens a blue bottled beverage)

        JERRY: Hmm.

        ELAINE: So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you?
        Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the
        Met.

        JERRY: Im sorry.

        ELAINE: George?

        GEORGE: Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?

        ELAINE: There's nobody I can go with.

        (Kramer enters)

        ELAINE: You know what. I don't have one female friend left.

        KRAMER: Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate
        other women, and they hate you.

        ELAINE: Thank you.

        KRAMER: So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we
        going to the movies?

        JERRY: Ah, how about 8:30?

        KRAMER: Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food
        -- takes a big bite)

        JERRY: You want to get something to eat first?

        KRAMER: [ mumbling with full mouth ] No, Im good.

        GEORGE: I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee
        table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands)
        heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the
        door and rushes out)

        KRAMER: There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos 
        afraid of
        a woman. (voice get high-pitched for the last line)

        JERRY: Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?

        ELAINE: George's Susan?

        JERRY: Yeah.

        ELAINE: Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks
        her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you
        guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)

        KRAMER: That's gunna be trouble.

        JERRY: Why?

        KRAMER: Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's
        sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's
        collide. You know what happens then?

        (Kramer raises his hands into the air and slowly brings them together 
        in
        an explosion. He's holding some food in one hand, so when his hands
        come into contact food flies all over)

        KRAMER: Ka shha shha shha Pkooo (exploding sound)

        New Scene.
        Camera fades from the apt. to the Paragon Movie Theater. Jerry and
        Kramer wait outside in a line to buy tickets.

        KRAMER: Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?

        JERRY: How come?

        KRAMER: Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.

        (Jerry looks at Kramer, raises his eyebrows with an expression that says
        really?)

        RAMON: (recognizes Jerry) Hey Jerry. How are you Mr. Backstroke?


        JERRY: Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.

        KRAMER: Oh, yeah.

        RAMON: So you know what happened don't chu?

        JERRY: No what?

        RAMON: I got fired.

        JERRY: Really?

        RAMON: Yeah, said I put too much chlorine in the pool.

        JERRY: Ahh.

        RAMON: Hey well, ah, stay out of the deep end, eh.

        JERRY: OK, see you later.

        KRAMER: What's in the deep end?


        New scene.
        Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside. Susan sits
        on the couch reading.

        [Telephone rings]

        GEORGE: Hello?

        ELAINE: Hey George.

        GEORGE: Hey Elainie. What's going on?

        ELAINE: (sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan

        GEORGE: Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. 
        he, he,
        he, he. Seriously, what's up?

        ELAINE: No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?

        GEORGE: Susan, why?

        ELAINE: Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.

        GEORGE: Oh, I don't think you want to do that.

        ELAINE: Why not?

        GEORGE: Well what would be the point of that?

        (Susan, hearing her name glances over at George)

        ELAINE: George, are you going to put her on the phone?

        GEORGE: Where did this come from all of a sudden?

        ELAINE: George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?

        GEORGE: I really think I should have been consulted about this.

        (George takes the phone from his ear and walks over to the couch and
        hands the phone to Susan)

        GEORGE: Here ... something.

        SUSAN: Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love
        that sort of stuff.

        (George stands behind the couch, arms crossed with his right hand
        clenched up to his mouth. He takes off his glasses, puts his left hand
        just above his eyes and rubs them in disbelief and walks out of the
        room.)

        New scene.
        Night exterior of a busy NYC street. Large lit advertising signs for
        Panasonic, JVC and a couple of McDonalds Golden Arches are 
        visible.
        Then to the inside of the movie theater.

        KRAMER: You want to sit here?

        JERRY: Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh,
        Over there. (points to the next seat over)

        KRAMER: Why?

        JERRY: Little buffer zone.

        KRAMER: (Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)

        JERRY: Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a
        movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?

        KRAMER: No. You got a point.

        JERRY: All right.

        KRAMER: I can't ...

        JERRY: What are you doing?

        KRAMER: Well these seats have no lumbar.

        JERRY: Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.

        (Ramon is looking for a seat. He's carrying a drink, a bunch of
        napkins, and a huge bucket of popcorn)

        KRAMER: We are talking.

        JERRY: Pretend it's interesting.

        KRAMER: So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are
        still looking for me.

        JERRY: Oh yeah that's shocking, but sounds ...

        RAMON: Hey, hi Jerry.

        JERRY: Oh, hey Ramon.

        RAMON: Hey, hey, I took a bunch of napkins. You want some?

        JERRY: Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)

        RAMON: Hey, ahhh, is this seat taken?

        (Ramon proceeds to sit down between Kramer and Jerry)

        JERRY: No.

        (As Ramon sits down, he bumps into Kramer and startles him. Jerry looks
        like he can't believe Ramon sat down. Ramon is bobbing his head front
        to back with his neck, like sitting there worked out pretty good)

        New scene.
        Exterior of Jerry's apartment building then inside where Jerry and
        George are talking.

        JERRY: And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us
        ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he
        walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally 
        I
        said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.

        GEORGE: By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?

        JERRY: No why?

        GEORGE: [sighs] She called Susan last night.

        JERRY: Oh yeah, I know.

        GEORGE: How do you know?

        JERRY: Well it was my idea.

        GEORGE: Your idea?

        JERRY: Yeah.

        GEORGE: Whad you do that for?

        JERRY: She was looking for someone to go to the show with.

        GEORGE: Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to
        happen now?

        JERRY: World's collide. (points at George)

        GEORGE: Whe ... Well yeah!

        JERRY: Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into
        contact with --

        GEORGE: YES! It Blows Up! So if you know that, what did you tell
        Elaine for?

        JERRY: I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.

        GEORGE: You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? 
        It's
        just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart.
        (gesturing with hands going outward)

        JERRY: Yeah, I guess I slipped up.

        (Kramer enters)

        KRAMER: Hey.

        GEORGE: Hey.

        JERRY: Hey.

        GEORGE: He knows the worlds theory.


        KRAMER: What is it blowing up?

        GEORGE: Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)

        [Telephone rings - Kramer pulls a cordless phone from his pocket]

        KRAMER: Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and
        pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me
        crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.

        JERRY: What is it?

        KRAMER: Well it's 555-3455.

        JERRY: 555-3455.

        KRAMER: Yeah.

        JERRY: (picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. 
        Well wait a
        second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.

        KRAMER: What's Filk?

        JERRY: Filks nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.

        KRAMER: Oh Movie Phone.

        JERRY: Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.

        KRAMER: So, Im Filk?

        JERRY: You're Filk.

        KRAMER: Oh, Mama.


        New scene.
        Susan and Elaine are walking down the sidewalk.

        ELAINE: Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th
        Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.

        SUSAN: Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette.

        ELAINE: Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.

        SUSAN: Whoo.

        ELAINE: Ha, ha, ha, ha.

        SUSAN: Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.

        ELAINE: What?

        SUSAN: Ehahh, forget it.

        ELAINE: What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.

        SUSAN: The vault?

        ELAINE: Mm-Hmm.



        New scene.
        Exterior shot of Physique (Jerry's health club) then inside to the men's
        locker room where Jerry is putting some clothes in a gym bag. Some men
        are in the background talking.

        PAUL - Locker room Attendant #1: Oy, Mr. Seinfeld. We heard you went to
        the movies with Ramon.

        JERRY: Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into
        him there. (putting on coat)

        DUSTIN - Locker room Attendant #2: It's a good thing he has friends like
        you to cheer him up.

        PAUL: Tell him to call us.

        DUSTIN: Tell him, Dustin says, Hello.

        JERRY: All right, I gotta go.

        PAUL: To see Ramon?

        (Paul, with his eyes wide open looking at Jerry. Dustin stares off the
        other direction, laughing to himself)


        New scene.
        Exterior of Jerry's apartment building, then inside Jerry's apartment.

        JERRY: What else did you two do?

        ELAINE: Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.

        JERRY: Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then
        back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?

        (Elaine stands there for a good 6 seconds with arms crossed, blank
        expression, just looking at Jerry)

        ELAINE: That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?

        JERRY: Yes, I do. (very serious)

        ELAINE: All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)

        JERRY: Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new
        friendship.

        ELAINE: Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom
        door)

        (Kramer enters and leaves the door open)

        KRAMER: Hey man, what's going on?

        JERRY: Hey.

        [Telephone rings]

        KRAMER: Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah
        hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.

        (Kramer walks over to the table, opens the newspaper to the movie
        section)

        KRAMER: Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 8:30, Sony Lincoln Square. 
        Yeah, no, no,
        no, no problem, yeah.

        (Kramer hangs up the cordless and pushes the antenna back in, puts the
        phone in his pocket)

        JERRY: You're looking up movies for people now?

        KRAMER: I got time.

        [Telephone rings]

        KRAMER: And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo
        here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, Ill help. Yeah, Firestorms
        good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it
        twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)

        JERRY: (shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.

        (Jerry is backing away, as Kramer attempt to foist the phone on to
        Jerry, but he will not take it -- Kramer continues to try and get Jerry
        to take the phone from him)


        ** Continuity Error -- During this part of the scene, we clearly see
        Kramers right hand holding the phone, his left hand is empty. This
        sequence is shot from several camera angles. At the end of the
        sequence, Kramer is holding the folded newspaper in his left hand -- he
        did not reach over to pick up the paper -- so this is obviously a
        Continuity Error **

        KRAMER: Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with
        you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still
        there? Look Im sorry about that. All right there's an 8:30 and a 
        10:15
        showing.

        (Kramer walks out the open door and into his apt. with the newspaper.
        Elaine walks back into the living room, wondering what just happened,
        she gestures towards Kramer as he exits)

        [Intercom buzzes]

        JERRY: Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?

        RAMON: [Hey it's Ramon]

        JERRY: What?

        RAMON: [Hey, It's Ramon Jerry. Im coming up]

        JERRY: (to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?

        ELAINE: Who? Who is Ramon?

        JERRY: He's the pool guy.

        ELAINE: What pool guy?

        JERRY: Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.

        ELAINE: Yeah, no problem.

        ----------------------------------------------------
        ** Inconsistency in reality -- Ramon shows up at Jerry's door, 8 seconds
        from the time when Jerry stops pressing the intercom buzzer. Either
        Ramon would have to run up 5 flights of stairs incredibly fast (he does
        not appear out of breath) or those are some very fast elevators.


        -- and we know from a Episode 6 The Ex-Girlfriend that Elaine complains
        about the slow elevators in Jerry's apt. building. **

        Episode 6 The Ex-Girlfriend
        ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city?
        That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.

        JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices,
        because you don't have to be home on time.
        ----------------------------------------------------

        RAMON: Hee hey, hey Jerry (claps hands and points both index fingers at
        him) How are you, crazy guy?

        JERRY: Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.

        ELAINE: Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she
        closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left
        him on his own)

        JERRY: So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?

        RAMON: Well, I was in the neighborhood. I figured Id check you out.

        JERRY: Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.

        RAMON: Oh, oh yeah. Wha? Where you going?

        JERRY: Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat
        and throws it over his shoulder)

        RAMON: Hey that's cool. Im up for some stuff

        JERRY: All right.

        (They head for the door)


        New scene.
        Moving subway cars blur by, then inside the subway car where Jerry sits
        next to Ramon

        RAMON: So get this. I get down there, and right away, I see the drain
        is clogged. I mean it's obvious. Can you believe it?

        JERRY: All right Ramon, Im going to get going.

        (Subway train stops and door opens)

        JERRY: I think we should separate here actually.

        RAMON: What are you trying to say Jerry?

        JERRY: Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only
        have three friends. I really can't handle any more.

        RAMON: Oh I see. It's cause I clean pools, right?

        JERRY: That has nothing to do with it.

        RAMON: You su -- [no audio] (through the moving subway window, Ramon is
        swearing and pointing at Jerry)


        New scene.
        Exterior of George's apartment building then inside his apartment.

        SUSAN: Yeah, we got along real well.

        GEORGE: You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't
        cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.

        SUSAN: Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.

        GEORGE: You talked all about that?

        SUSAN: Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.

        GEORGE: Did you just say vault?

        SUSAN: Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?

        GEORGE: You got that from Elaine.

        SUSAN: Yeah. So what?

        GEORGE: Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like
        Elaine from now on?

        SUSAN: I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie 
        on Friday.

        GEORGE: Wed all go to movie on Friday?

        SUSAN: Yeah.

        GEORGE: This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting
        upset!


        [Commercial]


        New scene.
        Inside Jerry's apartment -- Jerry sits on the couch listening to George.

        GEORGE: Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is
        allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him,
        Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but
        there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the
        George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar
        George, Bawdy George.

        JERRY: I, I love that George.

        GEORGE: Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks
        through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided
        against itself, Cannot Stand!

        (Elaine enters)

        GEORGE: You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?

        ELAINE: George I don't even want to get --

        GEORGE: You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
        hu, hu.

        ELAINE: So?

        GEORGE: She got that from you!

        ELAINE: Well, I didnt tell here to say it.

        GEORGE: What is she the only girl in the whole world? Why cant you 
        get
        find your own girl?

        ELAINE: I Like Her!

        GEORGE: You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about.
        It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits --
        slamming the door)

        JERRY: So you want to catch a movie later?

        ELAINE: Ahh, yeah, sure.

        JERRY: I don't have a paper though.

        ELAINE: Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials)

        ELAINE: Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?

        KRAMER: I don't know.


        New scene.
        Exterior of the Physique health club, then inside to the men's locker
        room.

        RAMON: Well, well. Look whos here.

        JERRY: Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.

        RAMON: No, I don't think so Jerry. You see they gave me my job back.

        JERRY: What?

        RAMON: Im a pool boy ... again.

        JERRY: Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. 
        I
        get a little crabby on the subway.

        RAMON: Do you?

        JERRY: What happened to all the towels?

        RAMON: Oh, ah, I guess they must have disappeared. (walks away)

        (Newman rushes up to Jerry)

        NEWMAN: Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit

        the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face
        with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.

        (Jerry extends his arms, making a vain attempt at a reach for a towel 
        as
        Newman walks away)


        New scene.
        Exterior of Elaine's building. Elaine and Jerry walk down the steps and
        on to the sidewalk.

        JERRY: It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of
        days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's
        always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...

        ELAINE: Uh-huh.

        JERRY: And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.

        ELAINE: Uhh, so frustrating!

        JERRY: Tell me about it.

        ELAINE: Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee
        shop?

        JERRY: You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?

        ELAINE: Yeah.

        JERRY: Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.

        ELAINE: Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.

        (Elaine walks off, while Jerry stands there contemplating the upcoming
        ramifications)


        New scene.
        Elaine and Jerry enter Monks coffee shop as Susan sits across the 
        booth
        from Kramer.

        SUSAN: Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here!

        KRAMER: There they are.

        SUSAN: Yeah, look who I ran into.

        KRAMER: Hey.

        ELAINE: Yeah. (sits down next to Susan)

        KRAMER: Yeah.

        ELAINE: Ahh.

        (Jerry stands a few paces from the booth, looking around for George, and
        feeling uncomfortable about the upcoming events)

        KRAMER: Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?

        JERRY: Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, 
        Ill
        wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)

        KRAMER: Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with
        you?

        JERRY: This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)

        (Jerry sits down next to Kramer)

        SUSAN: What's that Jerry?

        JERRY: [coughing] I said, boy am I ugly.

        (George enters the coffee shop)

        SUSAN: Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.

        (George walks in and stops, looking at the four of them sitting in the
        booth. He nods his head and extends his arm in acknowledgment, nods his
        head again, he lightly claps his hands and walks up to the table)

        GEORGE: One, two ... three, four.

        (extending his arm and counting to Elaine, Susan, Kramer and Jerry, who
        he puts his hand under Jerry's chin and then makes a fist and presses 
        it
        to Jerry's cheek)

        GEORGE: Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)

        SUSAN: Hey George!

        JERRY: We'll pull up another chair.


        New scene.
        Exterior of Reggies diner, then inside where George sits alone in 
        a
        booth. He eats in silence. A man sits at the counter, sipping coffee.


        New scene.
        Exterior shot of the Physique health club, then inside to the pool.
        Jerry is swimming while Ramon is cleaning the pool with a large squeegee
        on a long pole.

        JERRY: I see you there Ramon.

        (Ramon jabs a little bit at Jerry with the squeegee)

        JERRY: Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. 
        I know
        what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place 
        to
        swim.

        (Ramon pushes the squeegee out into Jerry's swim path -- Jerry grabs the
        squeegee pole and they struggle in a push-pull match)

        JERRY: Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.

        (Ramon loses his balance and Jerry pulls him into the pool)

        RAMON: Oh.

        (Newman runs towards the pool in one of those old time bathing suits)

        NEWMAN: Olly, olly, oxen, free!

        (It looks like Newman tries to do a cannonball into the pool, filmed in
        slow motion. Ramon looks up with a stunned look on his face, seeing
        Newman as he jumps into the pool on top of him.)

        JERRY: [NO!]

        Camera fade to Ramon, lying unconscious on the tile pool deck. Newman
        and Jerry are kneeling over him.

        JERRY: I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

        NEWMAN: Mouth-to-mouth?

        JERRY: Yeah.

        NEWMAN: Huh.

        JERRY: Well? Go ahead.

        NEWMAN: You go.

        JERRY: You knocked him out.

        NEWMAN: Yeah, but you pulled him in.

        JERRY: Come on Newman. Do it.

        NEWMAN: Nah.

        JERRY: He might die.

        NEWMAN: Yeah. Maybe.


        New scene.
        Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside where Susan
        and Elaine are sitting and talking.

        ELAINE: (on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater.
        (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 9:00, we can't wait any
        longer.

        SUSAN: Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just
        disappear.

        ELAINE: Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?

        SUSAN: Oh, I don't know.

        ELAINE: Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and
        writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with 
        Jerry.
        Love?

        SUSAN: Yeah.

        ELAINE: Love ... Susan.


        New scene.
        Camera fade to Elaine, Susan and Jerry outside the Paragon movie
        theater. It's night as they wait in line to buy tickets.

        JERRY: So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him
        mouth-to-mouth.


        ELAINE: He could have died

        JERRY: Yeah, it was a gamble.

        SUSAN: Why didnt you give him mouth-to-mouth?

        JERRY: Ah. (makes face)

        ELAINE: How can you possibly show your face there again?

        JERRY: Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know,
        we can't go anywhere near there.

        (they move up to the ticket window)

        ELAINE: Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. 
        (looking
        towards Jerry)


        New scene.
        Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside where George
        finds the note.

        GEORGE: What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see
Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. 
        Great!
        (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go
        with Jerry.

        [Rings]

        KRAMER: Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the
        movie you'd like to see, press one.

        GEORGE: Come on. Come on.

        KRAMER: Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three
        letters of the movie title, now.

        (George presses 3 keys)

        KRAMER: You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.

        GEORGE: What?

        KRAMER: Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct,
        press one.

        (George looks baffled)

        KRAMER: Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've
        selected.

        GEORGE: Chunnel?

        KRAMER: To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit
        zip-code, now.

        (George enters his zip-code)

        KRAMER: Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?

        GEORGE: Lowes Paragon, 84th and Broadway.

        KRAMER: (picks up paper) Chunnel, is playing at the Paragon 84th 
        Street
        cinema in the main theater at 9:30 PM.

        GEORGE: Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the
        door)

        KRAMER: It's also playing in theater number two at 9:00.


        New scene.
        Night exterior of United Artists Theater with a busy street in the
        foreground -- taxi's drive by. Then inside to a darkened theater,
        George, in the isle, searches for Jerry, Elaine and Susan. He's trying
        to be quiet and still get their attention.

        GEORGE: Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here.
        Elaine! Susan!

        MOVIE PATRON: SHH!

        (from the movie we hear this dialogue: The English Channel Tunnel,
        Chunnel, runs 32.3 miles, with two openings. One here, in England and
        another one here, in France. That's all we got. Thank you for your
        time gentlemen. Can I ask you a question Mr. McKittrick.

        -- it's a bit hard to hear the movie dialogue, as we are supposed to be
        focused on George, but I was able to make out most of it)


        New scene.
        Cut to Susan, Elaine and Jerry watching Chunnel in the theater 
        next
        door. Jerry is eating popcorn while Elaine sips a drink and eats a bit
        of popcorn

        JERRY: I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the
        plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?

        SUSAN: No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.

        (Susan looks irritated at Jerry and Elaine's talking)

        JERRY: What is he doing in the Chunnel?

        SUSAN: Would you two, Please?

        (movie voice - clearly it's Larry David's voice) [ Everybody out of the
        Chunnel! Everybody out! ]

        (Elaine and Jerry stop eating, sink back into their seats and look at
        each other, with silent expressions that say what is her problem.)

        (again, from the movie we hear this dialogue: Let me tell you
        something about the Chunnel, Mr. Thane. That our only freeway is
        adept. [inaudible] Elaine Brookstone will get the money bag
        [inaudible] Not as long as I have these long stickers. Find him and
        Kill him! I don't care if we have to turn this Chunnel upside down!
        Find Him! Everybody out of the Chunnel! Everybody out! The Chunnels
        gonna blow! AHHHHHH [Explosion]

        ** this time it's really tough to make all of it out, so there are some
        inaudible parts, but I tried to pick up most of it)


        New Scene.
        back to George in the other theater. He stands at the front of the
        theater, the movie screen behind and above him. He is still trying to
        find Jerry, Elaine and Susan.

        GEORGE: Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!

        MOVIE PATRON: [Hey, sit down!]

        GEORGE: Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!

        MOVIE PATRON: [Hey, we're trying to watch a movie here!]

        GEORGE: Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at
        me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry!
        Reggies!

        MOVIE PATRON: [Move it off of there!]

        GEORGE: Where are you!

        2nd MOVIE PATRON: [Hey are you sure you got the right theater?]

        GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel. Susan!

        2nd MOVIE PATRON: [It's playing in two theaters.]

        GEORGE: Two theaters?

        2nd MOVIE PATRON: [Yeah, there's a 9:00 too.]

        GEORGE: Oh. Sorry.

        (A large bucket of popcorn is thrown at George. He tries to deflect it,
        but the popcorn flies all over)

        (once again, from the movie we hear this dialogue: There's something
        else, your ex-wife. Alexandra? She's in France, Im telling ya. No,
        she's in the Chunnel. The Chunnel? No! Mr. President, Im sorry to
        disturb you. What is it? There's something about the Chunnel. Oh?
        [inaudible] And that means your daughter is in the Chunnel. Somewhere
        between France and ... [inaudible]

        ** Again, it's really tough to make all of it out, so there are some
        inaudible parts, but I tried to pick up most of it)


        New Scene.
        Elaine, Susan and Jerry exit the theater.

        ELAINE: I thought that was pretty good, huh?

        JERRY: Whad you think Susan?

        SUSAN: Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the
        whole movie.

        ELAINE: Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?

        JERRY: Yeah.

        SUSAN: Ah, no. I don't think so.

        ELAINE: Why not?

        SUSAN: Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop
        talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know
        how you can stand it. Ill see you.

        (Susan turns to walk away, but stops and looks at George being escorted

        out of the theater by two ushers. He struggles to try and stay inside
        the theater, but they forcefully remove him. Jerry, Elaine and Susan
        watch as George it escorted out -- he does not see the three of them
        standing there.)

        GEORGE: I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me.
        Together, laughing and lying.

        USHER: Let's go pal.

        GEORGE: They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're,
        they're all in on it! World's are colliding!

        [Camera freeze on George with the two ushers -- and into commercial]


        Final scene.
        Outside Kramers apartment door: 5B A partial view of a man's face 
        and
        his hand knocks 3 times on the door.

        MOVIE PHONE GUY: Hello, and welcome to your worst nightmare.

        (Kramer, sitting on the couch, reading the paper and eating cereal is
        obviously startled by the voice at his door)

        MOVIE PHONE GUY: (cont) I know your in there, Cosmo Kramer, Apartment
        5B. You're in big trouble, Now. You've been sealing my business. If
        you'd like to do this the easy way, open the door, Now. Or, please
        select the number of seconds, you'd like to wait, before I break this
        door down. Please select Now.

        (as the Movie Phone Guy talks, Kramer slides off the couch and ducks
        down under the coffee table, then pops back up with a dazed look.)

        5.14 Is there a real 555-FILM?

        When Kramer was given the phone number 555-FILK (easily confused with
        555-FILM)
        in "The Pool Guy" he was constantly called for movie showtimes. 
        The
        actual NY phone number is 212-777-FILM. Kramer's "Hewwo and welcome 
        to
        Movie phone" sounds exactly like the voice for the real number.

        I'm the first guy in. Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He
        see my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of

        Elaine: Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last

        year...

        Jerry: Sounds familiar.

        Elaine: The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--

        Jerry: Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.

        Elaine: Yes. I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once,
        ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.

        George: Ah, that is disgusting--

        Jerry: That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--

        George: The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--

        Jerry: It's wrong, it's rude, and it's--

        George: It's disgusting--

        Elaine (getting up to leave): Alright, there's no---

        George: Come on! Come-on.

        Jerry: We're only kidding!

        Elaine: You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She
        stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. I was at this party, and
        I was dating this really cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way,
        and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows
        her, right out the door!

        Jerry (excited): She's your Lex Luthor!

        Elaine: Her birthday's comin' up, so I decided to get her a little
        present.

        Jerry: What are you going to get her?

        Elaine: A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.

        Jerry: There's nothing subtle about that.

        George: No, no, she might just think its a gift.

        Jerry: Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?



        (Scene: The coffee shop)

        George: Ahhh, Hey-Ho.

        Jerry: What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at
        work?!?

        George: Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan
        for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin! 

        Jerry: So, you're just taking off from work?

        George: They won't know. I got the car there.

        Jerry: Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the
        verge of this big promotion?

        George: My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.




        (Scene: Elaine's office at J Peterman)

        Receptionist on Intercom: Sue Ellen Mishke to see you.

        Elaine: Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.

        (Sue Ellen enters, wearing the brazier as a top, with a black blazer)

        Sue Ellen: Hi Elaine.

        Elaine: Hellllloo.

        Sue Ellen: I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop
        in, and thank you for your lovely gift.

        Elaine: Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.

        Sue Ellen: Is anything wrong?

        Elaine: Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.

        Sue Ellen: Oh, I know. Thanks again.



        (Scene: The Rosses cabin)

        George: This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?

        Susan: Wanna check out a swap meet?

        George: Yeah, maybe. Where'd you get that?

        Susan: Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that

        rest stop.

        (George sits up suddenly)



        (Scene: Jerry's apartment, phone ringing)

        Jerry (answering phone): Yello.

        George: Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.

        Jerry: What's goin' on?

        George: I just remembered, there's this Chinese restaurant out near
        Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.

        Jerry: Yeah, so?

        George: Alright, this is what ya gotta do: I need ya to go out to the
        parking lot at Yankee Stadium, and take the flyers off my car.

        Jerry: You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three
        floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off
        your car, where does it end?!?

        George: Alright, alright. I'll drive the 4 hours each way, 6 hours all

        together, and take 'em off myself!!

        Jerry: Alright, alright, I'll do it!!

        (Jerry hangs up, Kramer enters Jerry's apartment)

        Jerry: Hey, what are ya up to?

        Kramer. Nothin'.

        Jerry: Do ya wanna go with me up to the Bronx and see if there's any
        flyers on George's car.

        Kramer (excited): Sure!

        Jerry: I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I?

        Kramer: yep.

        (Scene: Yankee Stadium parking lot.)

        (George's car is covered with flyers bird droppings)

        Jerry: Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if
        they see this? What are we gonna do?

        Kramer: I don't know.

        Jerry: Well, we gotta get it washed....Ah, the keys are locked inside!

        Kramer: Wait a second....


        Jerry: What are ya gonna do?

        Kramer: I'll just snag the lock with this. Here we go...

        Jerry: Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?

        (Scene: Jerry and Kramer driving George's car, after the car wash.
        Kramer is behind the wheel.)



        Kramer: George has gotta be happy about this.

        Jerry (indifferent): Yeah, yeah, yeah...

        Jerry: Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?

        (Sue Ellen is seen walking down the street)

        Kramer: Oh, mama.

        Jerry: Kramer!!!

        (Car crashes into a lamp post)

        (Commercial)

        (Scene: Jerry's Apartment)



        Elaine: My God, are you okay?

        Kramer: I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder.

        Jerry: I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it
        can make it.

        Elaine: So how did this happen?

        Jerry: He was starin' at some woman!

        Kramer: I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.

        Elaine: What woman?

        Jerry: There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing
        just a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.

        Elaine: Oh...my God.

        Jerry: What?

        Elaine: Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?

        Jerry: Yeah!

        Elaine: Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke! 

        Jerry: Sue Ellen Mishke?

        Elaine: That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The
        woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on,
        she's a menace to society.

        Kramer: You know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my

        golf swing. 

        (Kramer makes a golf swing motion and collapses in pain)

        (Stan enters)

        Stan (out of breath): I got your message, how's the shoulder?

        Kramer: Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!

        Stan: No, no. Not the left arm!

        Kramer: What happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour,
        and all my dreams?

        Elaine: Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!

        Kramer: Sue her?

        Elaine: Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar

        fortune.

        Kramer: No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee
        company.

        Elaine: Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime
        opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held

        accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!

        Kramer: What do you think, Stan?

        Stan: Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer?

        (Kramer smiles)

        (Scene: Jackie Chiles' office)



        Jackie: So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding
        your own business?

        Kramer: Yeah.

        Jackie: Then what happened?

        Kramer: The we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.

        Jackie: No top? She didn't have a top on? 

        Kramer: No. So I got distracted and I crashed the car.

        Jackie: Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was
        an attractive woman?

        Kramer: Oh, yeah.

        Jackie: So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin'
        around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions! 

        Kramer: She was flouting.

        Jackie: That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, vesivius, salacious,
        outrageous!

        Kramer: It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar

        fortune.

        Jackie: Could you repeat that?

        Kramer: I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.

        Jackie: O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got
        chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding!
        Have you been to a doctor?

        Kramer: No.

        Jackie (speaking to the intercom): Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an
        appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.

        Kramer: So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?

        Jackie: Like taking candy from a baby.

        (Scene: The cabin)



        George: I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim

        Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think?
        That way you have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got
        a team! Ha ha ha.

        Susan: I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.

        George: Would ya stop worrying? 

        Susan: Well, what about the flyers?

        George: Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing
        covered.

        (Scene: Yankee Stadium parking lot)

        (Jerry having difficulty parking the car. After getting the car in the
        space, Jerry leans against the door, trying to close it. Finally he
        gives up and leaves, kicking a piece of the car under it as he goes)



        (Scene: Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking)



        Steinbrenner: Come in!

        (Wilhelm enters)

        Steinbrenner: Ah, Wilhelm.

        Wilhelm: Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.

        Steinbrenner: How 'bout a 'good morning'?

        Wilhelm: Yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.

        Steinbrenner: Good morning to you, Wilhelm.


        Wilhelm: Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is based
        in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere.
        Obviously he was in some sort of terrible car accident, and, trooper
        that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.

        Steinbrenner: Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium
        scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen. Put everyone on

        alert, check all the area hospitals, clinics, shelters, we've gotta find

        that kid. 

        Wilhelm: Yes sir, yes sir.

        Steinbrenner: We must find George, find him, Wilhelm!

        (Scene: The hallway in Jerry's building)

        (As Jerry walks down the hall to his apartment, he finds Sue Ellen
        knocking on Kramer's door)



        Sue Ellen: Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the
        hall?

        Jerry (mesmerized): Yes, yes, I do.

        Sue Ellen: Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?

        Jerry: No, I don't.

        Sue Ellen: Oh...

        Jerry: Is there something I can help you with?

        Sue Ellen: No, I really just needed to speak with him.

        Jerry: Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.

        Sue Ellen: Oh, maybe I will.

        (Jerry quickly unlocks his door, before she can change her mind)

        Sue Ellen: If you don't mind.

        Jerry: No, no, not at all.

        Sue Ellen: Thanks.

        Jerry: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

        (Scene: Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking)

        Steinbrenner: What is with these people, all day long. Come in, come
        in.




        Wilhelm: Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, we've searched everywhere,
        there's no sign of him. Not even anyone who remotely fits his
        description, sir.

        Steinbrenner: Oh my God, do you know what this means, Wilhelm? 

        Wilhelm: What, sir?

        Steinbrenner: He's dead! Costanza's dead!

        Wilhelm: Well, no, no, you see, I don't think--

        Steinbrenner: As quickly as he came here, he's gone. The poor little
        guy! Easy. Easy, big Stein, get it together. Ok, Wilhelm.

        Wilhelm: Yessir?

        Steinbrenner: Find out where his parents live.

        Wilhelm: Parents.

        Steinbrenner: I'm gonna personally notify them. ...and, ah, line up
        some candidates to fill that assistant to the General Manager position,
        we can't grieve forever! We gotta get back to business! Back to
        Business Wilhelm!

        (Scene: Jerry's Apartment)

        (Kramer enters)



        Kramer: Well, buddy, he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on
        it! Right on it, he's all over it!

        Jerry (not happy): Oh, really?

        Kramer: Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?

        Jerry: I don't know, so the woman was walking around in a bra, I mean
        it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching
        the road. 

        Kramer: Well, your attitude has certainly changed.

        Jerry: I don't think my attitude has changed.

        Kramer: Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.

        Jerry: Well, I don't know if I....

        Kramer: Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!

        Jerry: I don't think I--

        Kramer: Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry,
        now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team,
        Jerry!

        Jerry: Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.

        Kramer: Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?

        Jerry: Nothing's happened.

        Kramer (in disgust): Goohhhhck. 

        (As Kramer begins to leave, he notices an O'Henry wrapper in the garbage

        can)



        Kramer (picking up the wrapper): Ohhhh, what's this?

        Jerry: Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second,...

        Kramer: I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't
        she?

        Jerry: Kramer, it is not what you think.

        Kramer: Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over

        this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're
        willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down

        the river.

        Jerry: And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander
        out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality
        O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!

        Kramer: You're just out for sex!

        Jerry: You're just out for money!

        Kramer and Jerry (together): Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!

        (Scene: The Costanza house, Queens)

        (Steinbrenner is knocking, Estelle open the door)



        Steinbrenner: Mrs. Costanza?

        Estelle (smiling): Yesss?

        Steinbrenner: My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some
        very sad new about your son.

        (Scene changes to Costanza living room)



        Estelle (crying): I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this
        have happened?

        Steinbrenner: Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first
        one in in the morning, last one to leave at night. That kid was a human

        dynamo.

        Estelle: Are you sure you're talking about George?

        Steinbrenner: You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?

        Frank (yelling): What the hell did you trade Jay Buhner for?!? He had
        30 home runs, over 100 RBIs last year, he's got a rocket for an arm, you

        don't know what the hell you're doin'!!

        Steinbrenner: Well, Buener was a good prospect, no question about it. 
        
        But my baseball people love Ken Phelps' bat. They kept saying 'Ken
        Phelps , Ken Phelps'.

        (Scene: Jerry entering his apartment, as Frank is leaving a message on

        his answering machine)



        Frank (from the answering machine): Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr.
        Steinbrenner is here, George is dead, call me back!

        (The phone rings again)

        Jerry (answering phone): Hello?

        George (other end of phone): Hey, it's George. 



        Jerry: Where have you been?!?

        George: What?

        Jerry: I just got the most bizarre message from you father,
        Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!

        George: Dead? 

        Jerry: Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a little
        crumpled.

        George: My car is a little crumpled?!?

        Jerry: Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the
        stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw
        the blood, they couldn't find ya, and now that's why Steinbrenner thinks

        you're dead!

        George: Okay, I gotta head back right away, I'll -- I gotta figure
        something out here.

        Jerry: Well you gotta call your parents.

        George: I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!

        Jerry: Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?

        George: Nnnooo! They could use the break!

        (Scene: Elaine's office at J Peterman)

        (Elaine is at her desk, Peterman enters)



        Peterman (holding up a bra): Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what
        I'm holding is my hands?

        Elaine: Yeah, it's a bra.

        Peterman: I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top.
        What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the
        elevator door closed. It was not to be. Perhaps our paths will cross
        again some day.

        Elaine: What is this all about?

        Peterman: I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's
        fashion. We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle: Zelda
        Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties,
        driving all the men crazy.....Have it on my desk by the end of the week.

        (Scene: Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking)

        Steinbrenner: Come in, come in.

        (George enters, with a bandage on his head, walking with crutches)



        George: Mr. Steinbrenner--

        Steinbrenner (shocked): Ahhh, Ahhh! Ah, ah ah! Is it you? 

        George: Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. After the
        car accident, I crawled into a ditch and managed to survive on grubs and

        puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.

        Steinbrenner: Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those. 

        George: Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I think I may have found
        a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up
        that much.

        Steinbrenner: Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new
        Assistant to the General Manager.

        George: I didn't get the job?

        Steinbrenner: Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our
        hands. We had to make a move...

        (Dejected, George turns to leave, no longer walking with he crutches,
        and takes the bandage off his head)

        Steinbrenner: But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have
        to dock you for the time you missed. We're running a ball club here.
        If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing
        you know its chaos! And I can tell you this, chaos does not work for
        the New York Yankees! Not as long as I'm running the show!

        (Scene: Courtroom)



        Jackie: So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy
        the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?

        Elaine (on the witness stand): Yes...ummm, yes, that's correct.

        (Sue Ellen leans back and smiles at Jerry, Kramer notices, worried)



        Jackie: And you have also brought with you, another bra, exactly like
        the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!

        Elaine: Yes, that's correct.

        (Kramer is now on the witness stand)


        Jackie: What was you golf score, the last round you played...before you

        shoulder was injured?

        Kramer: Three under par.

        (Stan nods proudly)

        Jackie (impressed): Oooohhhh, three under par...That's what the
        professionals shoot, isn't it?

        Kramer: If they're lucky.

        (Stan laughs)

        (Jerry is now on the witness stand)


        Jackie: Would you tell this jury exactly what you saw on the corner of
        83rd Street and Columbus?

        Jerry (hesitant): I...don't remember.

        Jackie: Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the
        bra?

        Jerry: I don't know. Maybe.

        Jackie: Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now
        I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing the
        bra?!?

        Jerry: ....Alright, alright, I saw her! And she was beautiful in that
        bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free
        wheeling attitude!

        Judge (banging his gavel): This court will come to order!

        Jackie: No further questions, your honor.

        Judge: You may step down.

        Jackie (to Kramer): I think we got this wrapped up.


        Kramer: Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?

        Stan: You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the
        cup.

        Kramer: What do you mean?

        Stan: Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.

        Jackie: No, no, no, no! 

        Kramer: Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.

        Jackie: Stan? Who the hell is Stan? 

        Kramer: He's my caddy.

        Jackie: You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake! 

        Kramer: G- cada-

        Jackie: Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on
        the bra.

        Judge: This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on.


        (Sue Ellen proceeds to try on the bra, over her top, but it seems too
        small)



        Sue Ellen: Ah, it doesn't fit...I can't put it on.

        Jackie (to Kramer and Stan): Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin'

        now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin'
        to a caddy! This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant
        have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on
        over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A
        bra gotta fit right up a person's skin, like a glove!

        (Scene: Elaine's office)

        (Two women enter wearing bras as tops)

        Woman #1: Oh, hey, Elaine, how 'bout some lunch?

        Elaine: Oh, no, I don't think so.

        Woman #2: Great job on the Gatzby Swing Top. It's a winner.

        Elaine: Yeah, yeah, thanks.

        Woman #1: Are you sure you don't wanna go? We have reservations. 

        Elaine: Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.

        Woman #1: Ciao.

        Woman #2: Ba-bye.

        (Elaine makes a gun with her fingers and points it to her head)



        [Nightclub]

        Jerry's opening monologue.

        JERRY: The other thing I love is when you're in the middle of a dream, 
        and
        the alarm goes off. You incorporate the sound of the alarm into the dream, 
        so
        you can keep sleeping. And you'll make any adjustment in the dream to 
        do it.
        I was with Marie Antoinette in a dream last night, and she was on the
        guillotine, the blade came down, her head fell into the basket, it rolled
        over and she started singing Neil Diamond's 'Solitary Man'. And, I thought,
        "That is not my alarm going off. This is actually happening."


        [Street, New York]

        An elated George leaps around the corner, kicking a cab's door closed 
        and
        clapping his hands together.

        GEORGE: (joyful) June. It's June.

        George begins trotting down the street. He acknowledges a passerby and
        high-fives him.

        GEORGE: (high-fiving) Hey!

        George continues his joyful path along the sidewalk, with his hands raised
        above his head in celebration.

        GEORGE: It's June.     

        George takes the hand of a female passerby and dances a few steps with 
        her,
        twirling her round.

        GEORGE: June, June, June.

        Releasing the woman, George euphorically prances along, laughing and smiling.

        GEORGE: (to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.

        George leaps onto the footing of a streetlight and spins on it, in
        time-honoured musical fashion.

        GEORGE: It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.

        George leaps from the streetlight onto the road, where he spreads his 
        arms
        and spins.

        GEORGE: I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!

        A car brakes behind George and sounds its horn. George flinches, and jigs
        nervously out from in front of the automobile and back to the pavement.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        George pushes open the door and enters, still ebullient. He punches the 
        air
        as he looks to Jerry.

        GEORGE: June. Juune, baby!

        JERRY: What?

        GEORGE: The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. 
        It's
        like a stay of execution.

        JERRY: Dead man walking.

        GEORGE: (pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my 
        lucky
        day.

        JERRY: Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.

        GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's
        best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.

        JERRY: She did?

        GEORGE: Yeah.

        JERRY: So? Wheels?

        GEORGE: In motion. The wheels are in motion.

        JERRY: Beautiful.

        GEORGE: Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it.
        Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost 
        as good
        as if I didn't get married.

        JERRY: So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars 
        Club.

        GEORGE: The Friars Club?

        JERRY: Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me 
        up for
        membership.

        Kramer opens the door and leans in.

        KRAMER: Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? 
        I got
        a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty
        minutes, alright?

        JERRY: Catnap?

        KRAMER: No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading 
        this
        book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?

        JERRY: (deadpan) That must be some book.

        KRAMER: Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes 
        every
        three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm 
        awake
        per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have 
        lived
        the equivalent of a hundred and five years.

        JERRY: Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.

        KRAMER: Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.

        Kramer heads for the door.

        JERRY: I didn't know you had a hopper.

        KRAMER: (smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.

        Kramer exits, closing the door behind him.


        [Conference Room, J. Peterman]


        A number of executives are seated round a table, with J Peterman at the 
        head
        of the table.

        PETERMAN: Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met
        good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.

        Peterman indicates a guy sitting next to Elaine. The other executives 
        give
        Bob some quiet applause, which he acknowledges with a slight wave.

        BOB: Thanks. Hi everybody.

        PETERMAN: Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.

        Elaine leans over to the guy sitting on the other side of her from Bob.

        ELAINE: (whispers) Poor bastard.

        PETERMAN: (to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the
        copy-editing for the new catalogue.

        Bob looks blank and fiddles with something behind his ear.

        BOB: Ah, could you repeat that?

        PETERMAN: (slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?

        Bob pulls a face and points to indicate all is not well with his hearing.

        BOB: (apologetic) I..I'm sorry. What?

        PETERMAN: (louder still) Copy-editing!

        Peterman sees he's not getting through to Bob, and gives up.

        PETERMAN: Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it.

        Elaine does a double-take at hearing this, looking dismayed. Bob has a
        hearing aid out of his ear and manipulates it before slipping it back 
        in.


        [Friars Club Lobby]

        Jerry, George, Susan, and Hallie stand before the maitre d' of the rather
        fancy Friars Club. Jerry has no jacket

        JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.

        MAITRE D': Yes, Mr Seinfeld, but uhm, all gentlemen are required to wear
        jackets in the dining room.

        JERRY: (downcast) Oh, I'm sorry.

        HALLIE: (smiling) How embarrassing this must be for you.

        JERRY: (jocular) You just bought your own dinner.

        George, Susan and Hallie laugh at his little joke.

        MAITRE D': No problem. Please, follow me.

        The maitre d' strides away, Jerry follows.

        JERRY: (passing Hallie) 'Scuse me.

        GEORGE: (smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.

        A couple of people walk by, George raises a hand in greeting.

        GEORGE: Friars.

        Jerry returns, wearing a blazer, with a crest on the breast pocket.

        JERRY: Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing 
        here.

        George, Susan and Hallie, all make positive noises and comments. The maitre
        d' comes up behind Jerry and motions them to enter.

        MAITRE D': This way please.

        GEORGE: Hup, here we go. Here we go.

        The four of them walk on into the restaurant, with George bringing up 
        the
        rear.


        [Friars Club Restaurant]

        Jerry, George, Susan and Hallie, sit round a table, eating. They're engage 
        in
        at least two separate conversations - Jerry with George and Susan with
        Hallie.

        GEORGE: (adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. 
        It's
        not that hard

        Jerry looks scornfully at George.

        SUSAN: (to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this 
        fish.
        It's really delicious.

        Hallie spears a morsel from Susan's plate and eats it.

        JERRY: (to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.

        GEORGE: (to Jerry) Oh, get outta here.

        JERRY: (to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest
        thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is 
        the
        same guy from *Seals and Croft*.

        HALLIE: (to Susan) Mmm, it is good.

        SUSAN: (to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?

        GEORGE: (to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you,
        look at him.

        HALLIE: (to Susan) Oh. Remember (indistinct) wedding?

        JERRY: Oh, come on.

        GEORGE: Look...

        JERRY: Alright.

        The four continue chatting happily.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Kramer is asleep on Jerry's couch. Jerry enters, wearing a long coat.

        JERRY: (looking at Kramer) This is nice.

        Jerry slams the door and Kramer jerks awake.

        KRAMER: Yeah, morning.

        JERRY: Morning?

        Jerry removes his coat, to reveal he's wearing the crested jacket from 
        the
        Friars Club.

        KRAMER: Yeah, what time is it?

        JERRY: (looks at watch) Ten-thirty.

        KRAMER: (pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night
        ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?

        Kramer passes Jerry on his way to the kitchen. Jerry looks downwards at 
        his
        attire.

        JERRY: (realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. 
        It
        belongs to the Friars Club.

        Kramer has a bowl on the counter and fetches a box of cereal.

        KRAMER: Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright,
        here we go.

        JERRY: Breakfast?

        KRAMER: (pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.

        JERRY: So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?

        KRAMER: (enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I 
        have
        never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to 
        this
        idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only 
        peanut
        butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)

        JERRY: What d'you call it?

        KRAMER: P B and J's. What d'you think?

        JERRY: (deadpan) I think you need more sleep.

        KRAMER: (dismissive) Ahh.

        Kramer picks up his bowl of cereal and heads for the door.

        JERRY: So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?

        Kramer stops, with the door open, and turns back to Jerry.


        KRAMER: I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave 
        the
        apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.

        JERRY: Oh, now you're being ridiculous.

        KRAMER: (laughing) He he, yeah.

        Kramer begins to exit.

        JERRY: (indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk?

        KRAMER: Oh, I'll be back.

        Kramer leaves and closes the door behind him.


        [Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]

        It's late at night, and her's is the only light on in the building. Elaine
        sits at a computer, typing away at the keyboard. She's surrounded by piles 
        of
        paperwork, which she rummages through. She sighs, frustrated at being 
        saddled
        with all this work.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        It's night, and Jerry lies in bed asleep. Kramer enters the room quietly 
        and
        sits on the edge of Jerry's bed.

        KRAMER: (quietly) Jerry.

        Jerry stirs slightly, but doesn't wake up.

        KRAMER: (quietly) Hey Jerry.

        Jerry still doesn't wake.

        KRAMER: (prodding Jerry) C'mon buddy.

        Jerry snaps awake, sitting up and recoiling from the figure on his bed.

        JERRY: (startled) Kramer!

        KRAMER: You awake?

        JERRY: (confused) Wha..? What time is it?

        KRAMER: W...It's four.

        JERRY: (aghast) Four in the morning?!

        KRAMER: Yeah.

        JERRY: Well, what's wrong with you?

        KRAMER: I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what 
        to do.
        You wanna do something?

        JERRY: No. Would you just get out?

        KRAMER: You wanna rent a movie?

        JERRY: No!

        KRAMER: Well, what am I gonna do?


        [Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]

        Jerry walks over to Elaine, who is working at her computer. She has a
        sandwich and a diet soda on her desk.

        JERRY: Ready for lunch?

        ELAINE: (irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because 
        of
        stupid Bob Grossberg.

        Jerry pulls a face, helps himself to a sandwich and sits down, as Elaine
        turns to him.

        ELAINE: Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every
        time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, 
        and it
        all gets dumped on me.

        JERRY: You think he's faking?

        ELAINE: I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's 
        real.

        Bob leans around the open door to speak.

        BOB: Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.

        Jerry waves a finger in greeting.

        BOB: (to Elaine) Just wanted to say hi.

        Bob makes to depart, but stops as Elaine speaks.

        ELAINE: Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could 
        give
        me a hand with some of the catalogue?

        BOB: (cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?

        Elaine leans toward Bob.

        ELAINE: (slower and louder) I'm kind of swamped.

        Bob smiles, and holds his tie, as if he's been complimented on it.

        BOB: Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.

        Bob smiles, gives Elaine a wink and leaves.

        ELAINE: Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?

        JERRY: That was him?

        ELAINE: Yes.

        JERRY: Somehow I thought he'd be taller.

        ELAINE: Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, 
        okay? I
        got a lotta work to do.

        JERRY: (standing) Alright, I'll see you later.

        Elaine turns back to her computer. Jerry heads out the door.

        ELAINE: Alright.


        [Peterman Bathroom]

        Bob stands at the urinal. Jerry opens the door and enters the room. He 
        sees
        Bob, and wonders about something. Jerry slowly crosses the room until 
        he's
        standing about three feet behind Bob.

        JERRY: Hey, Bob.

        Bob continues to use the urinal, without reaction.

        JERRY: Bob.

        Still no reaction.

        JERRY: Hey, Bobby, over here.

        Bob continues his necessary business.

        JERRY: Bob. Oh, Bob.

        Still nothing.

        JERRY: (louder) Bob!

        Bob finishes what he has to do, and half-turns to find Jerry behind him.
        Jerry feigns innocence, Bob completes his zipping up whilst faced away 
        from
        Jerry.

        BOB: Hi.

        Jerry and Bob give embarrassed acknowledgement smiles.


        [Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]

        Elaine types away at her computer. Jerry enters.

        JERRY: (urgent whisper) Elaine.

        Jerry closes the door behind him.

        ELAINE: (makes an irked noise)

        JERRY: I was just in the bathroom.

        ELAINE: (really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm 
        really
        busy here.

        JERRY: No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.

        ELAINE: So what?

        JERRY: No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.

        Elaine stands and slaps Jerry on the chest with a bundle of papers.


        ELAINE: Get out! What'd you do?

        JERRY: Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see 
        if he
        could hear me.

        ELAINE: (hopeful) And?

        JERRY: Well, he flinched, sort of.

        ELAINE: What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?

        JERRY: Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the 
        zip up,
        I dunno.

        ELAINE: So you don't know anything?

        JERRY: Actually, no.

        ELAINE: (sarcasm) Alright, good job.

        JERRY: Right.

        Elaine goes back to work. Jerry leaves.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry sits, reading a paper, at the table. There is a knock at the door.

        JERRY: Come in.

        The door slowly opens wide enough for George to lean into the room. He's
        smiling, looks at Jerry and raises his eyebrows quizzically. Jerry smiles
        back.

        GEORGE: (entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that
        something?

        JERRY: That was something.

        GEORGE: Ah. She's great, isn't she?

        JERRY: (positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.

        GEORGE: I told you.

        JERRY: I'm nuts about her.

        GEORGE: You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?

        JERRY: She could be an 'it'.

        GEORGE: (claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!

        JERRY: She's got 'it' written all over her.

        GEORGE: She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's
        intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.

        JERRY: Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.

        GEORGE: Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.

        JERRY: Whatever.

        GEORGE: (gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they 
        always
        like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?

        JERRY: That doesn't sound right.

        GEORGE: No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working
        on. The Flying Sandos Brother.

        JERRY: Flying Sandos. Beautiful.

        GEORGE: Great. Seven-thirty, alright?

        JERRY: Walk me down to the Friars.

        Jerry goes into the bedroom.

        GEORGE: Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. 
        If
        you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...

        Jerry reenters looking confused.

        JERRY: It's not here.

        GEORGE: What?

        JERRY: Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.

        Kramer enters, rubbing his eyes.

        KRAMER: Oh, boy.

        Jerry is looking around for the jacket, lifting cushions, etc.

        JERRY: (to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night.
        (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?

        KRAMER: Oh, the one with the crest.

        JERRY: Yeah.

        JERRY: Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.

        JERRY: The cleaners? How did it get there?

        KRAMER: Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.

        JERRY: (irritated) Great.

        KRAMER: (laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile 
        of
        garbage.

        JERRY: Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!

        KRAMER: Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight 
        at six.

        JERRY: Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the 
        show.

        GEORGE: Won't be a problem...(mumbles)

        Kramer has closed his eyes and fallen asleep while leaning on the counter 
        in
        Jerry's kitchen.

        JERRY: (to Kramer) Hey.

        Kramer does not respond.

        JERRY: (louder) Hey!!

        Kramer snaps awake with a jerk.

        KRAMER: Watch out, boy.


        [Bob's Office, J. Peterman]

        Bob is working at his desk, with his back to the door. Elaine arrives 
        and
        stands in the doorway.

        ELAINE: Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?

        Bob continues to muse over some of the work in front of him, giving no 
        sign
        of knowing Elaine is there.

        ELAINE: Bob!

        Bob still doesn't react to Elaine. Elaine takes a couple of steps into 
        Bob's
        office, and decides to try a different tactic.

        ELAINE: (sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...

        As Elaine speaks, Peterman walks past the open door. Hearing Elaine's 
        voice,
        his attention is caught. He stops to listen.

        ELAINE: ...so much. You're so damn...sexy.

        Peterman watches and listens, surprised.

        ELAINE: (sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.

        Peterman decides he should withdraw, and he leaves.

        ELAINE: (dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?

        Bob continues to be oblivious to Elaine. Elaine pulls a pensive face and
        leaves.


        [Theatre]

        George, Susan and Hallie sit in a box overlooking the stage (just like 
        the
        two guys in the Muppets). There's an empty seat beside Hallie. George 
        is
        making small talk.

        HALLIE: Well, they perform all over. Europe mostly.

        GEORGE: A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours.

        HALLIE: Yeah.

        Jerry arrives, wearing the crested jacket.


        JERRY: Sorry, sorry I'm late.

        GEORGE/SUSAN: Hey!

        SUSAN: Jerry.

        GEORGE: Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?

        Jerry takes the vacant seat.

        JERRY: Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.

        GEORGE: Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about
        these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.

        JERRY: Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.

        Lively music begins and the Flying Sandos Brothers bound onto the stage 
        to
        applause from the auditorium. Jerry and his friends all join in.


        [Kramer's Apartment]

        Kramer sits on his couch with Connie, who is playfully toying with the 
        collar
        on his shirt.

        KRAMER: So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?

        CONNIE: Mmm, no, Cosmo. I like just being here with you.

        KRAMER: Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.

        Connie leans in and begins to kiss Kramer's neck.

        KRAMER: Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.


        [Theatre]

        The Sandos Brothers are on stage performing a juggling act with glasses,
        trays and bottle. It ends with them pouring drinks and toasting the audience.
        The audience applaud appreciatively.

        The Sandos Brothers launch into the next part of their act. One brother
        climbs onto the shoulders of another and is carried to the edge of the 
        stage,
        where he climbs from the shoulders into the box containing Jerry, George,
        Susan and Hallie. The audience applaud.

        SANDOS BROTHER 1: How would you kind people like to lend a hand with our 
        next
        trick?

        JERRY: (smiling) I don't think so.

        SANDOS BROTHER 1: Please, take off your jacket.

        JERRY: My jacket?

        SANDOS BROTHER 1: Yes, the jacket. (turns to the crowd) What do you say,
        ladies and gentlemen?

        The rest of the audience cheer and clap.

        SANDOS BROTHER 1: (to Jerry) Can't argue with that.

        HALLIE: C'mon.

        SUSAN: Do it. Come on, Jerry.

        GEORGE: Give him the jacket.

        JERRY: (giving in) Alright.

        Jerry shrugs out of the jacket, to the applause of friends and audience. 
        He
        hands it to the Sandos Brother.

        SANDOS BROTHER 1: And now, we say the magic word. (gestures with his hand)
        Agrabah! And we make it disappear.

        As he finishes his speech, he tosses the jacket out of the box and into 
        the
        audience. The audience clap, as do George, Susan and Hallie. Jerry peers 
        over
        the edge of the box, after the jacket.


        [Kramer's Apartment]

        Connie lies on the couch, underneath Kramer. She strokes the side of his 
        head
        with her fingers.

        CONNIE: (passionate) Oh Cosmo. Mm-mmm, Cosmo. Oh Cosmo.

        Kramer is oddly unresponsive.

        CONNIE: (uncomfortable) Uh, honey, can you move a little, this hurts.

        Kramer makes no reply.

        CONNIE: (worried) Cosmo?

        Connie pushes at Kramer to try and move him.

        CONNIE: (panicky) Oh my god. Cosmo, wake up!

        Connie heaves harder at Kramer, but he's still not moving or replying.

        CONNIE: Cosmo?

        Connie lifts Kramer's head and looks at his face, which is completely 
        slack
        and expressionless.

        CONNIE: (horrified) Oh my god! He's dead! He's dead.

        Panicky, Connie tries again to lift Kramer enough to get out, but is unable
        to move his inert bulk. She reaches across to the table and grabs the 
        handset
        of the phone. Quickly, she dials a number and puts the phone to her ear.

        CONNIE: (into phone) Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie. You gotta help me. Some 
        guy
        dropped dead on top of me. (listens) I can't call the cops, 'cos Joey 
        might
        find out. (listens) I can't. I'm stuck. You gotta help me.


        [Theatre, Backstage]

        Jerry leads George and the girls up to a door marked 'Dressing Room 3'.

        GEORGE: This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.

        Jerry knocks on the door. It's opened after a second, by one of the Sandos
        Brothers who looks at Jerry, questioningly.

        JERRY: Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. 
        I just
        wanted to pick it up.

        SANDOS BROTHER 2: Jacket? What jacket?

        JERRY: (explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the
        audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.

        SANDOS BROTHER 2: A..are you sure it was me?

        JERRY: Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.

        Jerry looks past to where another couple of Sandos Brother are still
        changing.

        SANDOS BROTHER 2: Well, two of them have left already.

        The Sandos Brother at the door turns to the other two an rattles off a
        question in some foreign language. The other two speak to each other and
        reply to the question, also in a foreign tongue, but clearly they don't 
        know
        anything.

        SANDOS BROTHER 2: (shaking his head apologetically) No.

        JERRY: It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.

        SANDOS BROTHER 2: Sorry.

        The Sandos Brother closes the door, smiling.

        HALLIE: Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.

        JERRY: (cynical) I'm sure it won't.

        HALLIE: Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.

        GEORGE: (cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back.
        (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?

        JERRY: (downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.

        SUSAN: Aww, that's too bad.

        GEORGE: Really?

        JERRY: Yeah, we'll do it another time.

        SUSAN: (bright) George, we'll go.

        George doesn't look like the prospect of coffee alone with Susan is something
        he relishes.


        [Monk's]

        George and Susan sit either side of a table, with coffee. There's a definite

        lack of sparkling conversation. George forces a smile at Susan. There's 
        a
        long pause, broken only by Susan sighing. George finally thinks of something
        to say.

        GEORGE: I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.

        SUSAN: Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.

        GEORGE: Okay.

        SUSAN: So, what colour?

        GEORGE: Brown.

        Susan nods her comprehension, as George muses for a moment.

        GEORGE: Maybe a black.

        SUSAN: Mmm.

        The waitress walks by the table with the coffee pot.

        WAITRESS: More coffee?

        GEORGE: (urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please.

        The waitress pulls the check from her pocket and puts it on the table 
        for
        George.


        [Hallway Outside Jerry's Apartment]

        As Jerry walks up to his door, Kramer's door opens and two guys emerge
        carrying a large body-shaped object wrapped in fabric. They carry it away
        down the hall.

        JERRY: (looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.

        Jerry shakes his head at Kramer's antics as he enters his apartment.


        [A Lonely Stretch Of Road On The Banks Of The Hudson]

        It is night. A large black car squeals to a stop beside the river. The 
        two
        guys we just saw leave Kramer's apartment climb out of the car. They open 
        the
        trunk and haul out the wrapped object they were carrying. They lug it 
        to the
        rail at the edge of the road, and heave it over the edge. It splashes 
        into
        the river and begins to sink. The two guys quickly close the trunk of 
        the car
        and climb back in.


        [Beneath The Hudson River]

        The object sinks down into the water. Suddenly, the contents begin to 
        squirm
        and jump. The outline of a human body can be seen within the fabric. The 
        top
        of the wrappings opens and Kramer emerges. He looks around, wide-eyed, 
        and
        would scream with shock, were he not underwater. He kicks his legs and 
        swims
        toward the surface.


        [The Hudson River]

        Kramer breaks the surface with a splutter. He looks round, panicky and
        confused.

        KRAMER: HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!!

        Kramer looks to one side, where he sees a large ferry bearing down on 
        him. He
        turns and begins swimming away from the vessel.

        KRAMER: AAH! AAGH!


        [Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]

        Elaine is working away, when Peterman enters behind her. He's carrying 
        a
        couple of bits of card.

        PETERMAN: Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.

        Peterman sits on the edge of Elaine's desk.

        ELAINE: (shrugging it off) Oh.

        PETERMAN: So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to 
        the
        Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.

        ELAINE: (pleased) Ah.

        PETERMAN: It is a real hoot.

        ELAINE: (delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman.

        PETERMAN: Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off 
        a
        little early, so you both can get ready.

        Elaine looks confused. Peterman begins to leave.

        ELAINE: Mr Peterman, you...

        PETERMAN: (interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every
        word you said.

        Elaine realises what Peterman overheard.

        PETERMAN: And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap.
        (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.

        ELAINE: (resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry is on the phone, as George enters.

        JERRY: (into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. 
        (to
        George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let 
        a
        jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred
        dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!

        Jerry stalks about as George sits on the couch.

        JERRY: (worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take
        your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!

        GEORGE: It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, 
        dinner
        at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.

        JERRY: (unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so.

        GEORGE: (worried) Why not?

        JERRY: (impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.

        GEORGE: (standing) C'mon, what're you talking about?

        JERRY: Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.

        GEORGE: You're soured?

        JERRY: Yeah, I'm soured.

        GEORGE: Don't be soured.

        JERRY: I'm sorry. I'm soured.

        GEORGE: (animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so 
        well.
        Where is all this coming from?

        JERRY: Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about 
        my
        jacket.

        GEORGE: (animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She 
        said
        she was gonna get it back.

        JERRY: (indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.

        GEORGE: (worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason
        to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?

        JERRY: I'll try and de-sour.

        GEORGE: (aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour.
        You have to sweeten too!

        JERRY: (sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.

        GEORGE: I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.

        JERRY: I still don't know what that means.

        GEORGE: (neither does he) Yeah, well.

        The door opens and Kramer enters, fully dressed but soaked to the skin.

        KRAMER: God.

        JERRY: (astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!


        KRAMER: (animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!

        JERRY: Who?

        KRAMER: (shouts) Connie!

        JERRY: What'd she do?

        KRAMER: I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson 
        river
        in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling 
        the
        cops.

        JERRY: (bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?

        KRAMER: (animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else 
        to
        have me!

        Kramer moves to leave, but walks into the door with a loud thud.

        KRAMER: (to door) Gah!

        Kramer stomps away to his own apartment.


        [Friars Club Lobby]

        Jerry and George stand where they dealt with the maitre d' on their previous
        visit. As they wait, they're people-watching.

        JERRY: Hey, there's uncle Milty.

        GEORGE: (pleased) Yeah, it is.

        JERRY: (pointing) And there's David Steinberg.

        GEORGE: The comedian, or the manager?

        JERRY: The manager.

        George looks unimpressed. Pat Cooper comes walking toward Jerry and George.

        JERRY: (to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.

        PAT: Hey, Jerry. What the hell went wrong? What's the matter with you? 
        Are
        you a kleptomaniac, or what?

        JERRY: I forgot to take it off.

        PAT: (dubious) You forgot to take it off? Oh, you go into a department 
        store,
        you put a suit on, and you walk right out. What are you some sort of an
        idiot?

        JERRY: I'm sorry.

        PAT: Where's the jacket?

        JERRY: Well, one of the gypsies took it.

        PAT: (skeptical) Aww, the gypsies took it! Of course, New York has a lot 
        of
        gypsies! Oh, on every block there's a gypsy!

        GEORGE: (meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it.

        PAT: (probing) Excuse me, are you an entertainer? Are you in showbusiness?

        GEORGE: No, I uh...

        PAT: (interrupting) Then what am I talking to you for? (to Jerry) Jerry,
        bring the jacket back tomorrow.

        JERRY: Alright.

        Pat Cooper walks away from the guys. Jerry motions for George to leave 
        with
        him. George looks round and sees something.

        GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

        Over at one of the tables, the Sandos Brother who took Jerry's jacket 
        is
        entertaining some other guests. He's wearing a familiar crested jacket.

        GEORGE: Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show?
        He's..he's wearing the jacket.

        JERRY: God, you're right.

        GEORGE: (motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon.

        Jerry and George walk into the Friars Club, but within a couple of strides
        they are faced with the maitre d'.

        MAITRE D': Wait a second! Excuse me gentlemen, are you members?

        JERRY: Well, I'm a prospective member.

        MAITRE D': Until then, (pointing) that's the way out.

        JERRY: But that guy has my jacket.

        MAITRE D': C'mon, let's go.

        The maitre d' shepherds Jerry and George out of the door, despite their
        continuing protests.

        GEORGE: Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...

        MAITRE D': Come on.

        JERRY: Come on.

        MAITRE D': Let's go.

        GEORGE: If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...

        Jerry and George are ejected from the Friars Club.


        [Theatre]

        Elaine and Bob sit in the same box used by Jerry, George, Susan and Hallie.
        Elaine looks distinctly unenthused at the prospect of spending the evening
        with Bob. Bob looks delighted to be ensconced with Elaine.

        BOB: These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give 
        us
        these tickets.

        ELAINE: (flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice.

        Bob slips one hand round the back of Elaine's seat and leans slightly 
        toward
        her.

        BOB: (smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?

        Elaine looks at Bob, wondering what he's talking about. Bob dives across 
        at
        Elaine, putting his arms round her and his face on her chest.

        ELAINE: (pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.

        Elaine succeeds in heaving Bob away from her. She looks at him, angrily.

        ELAINE: Get offa me!

        Bob stands for a few seconds, with Elaine glaring at him. Then he dives 
        in
        for another go. Elaine struggles with him again.

        ELAINE: Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats)
        Get a hold of yourself!

        Bob slowly gets to his feet. Elaine glares at him, and Bob shamefacedly
        shuffles away out of the box.


        [Theatre, Backstage]

        Jerry and George come round a corner in a dingy corridor at the theatre.

        JERRY: I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.

        GEORGE: I told you, he probably went out the back.

        Along the corridor comes the Sandos Brother who took Jerry's jacket. He 
        has a
        jacket slung over one shoulder. Jerry and George collide with him.

        JERRY: Ouf.

        Jerry recognises the guy.

        JERRY: Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!

        SANDOS BROTHER 1: No, it is not. It is my jacket.

        The Sandos Brother backs away from the advancing Jerry and George.

        JERRY: (adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.

        SANDOS BROTHER 1: No, it is not. This is mine.

        JERRY: C'mon I need it.

        Jerry grabs hold of the jacket and begins a tug-of-war with it. George 
        joins
        in, trying to release the grip of the Sandos Brother. The door to 'Dressing
        Room 3' opens and Hallie emerges and watches the struggle.

        JERRY: (determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.

        GEORGE: Give 'im the jacket already!


        Jerry and George succeed in taking the jacket. The Sandos Brother runs 
        away
        down the corridor, shouting.

        SANDOS BROTHER 1: (yelling) Help! Help! (foreign language) Azobar! Azobar
        disay!

        GEORGE: What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!

        JERRY: Can you believe it?!

        Jerry looks at the jacket they took, and notices something.

        JERRY: (examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is
        different. It's got a moose on it.

        GEORGE: Moose?

        JERRY: Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.

        HALLIE: No, it's not.

        Hallie reaches inside the door of Dressing Room 3 and pulls out a jacket 
        on a
        hanger.

        HALLIE: This is the jacket.

        Jerry and George look mortified. Hallie brings the jacket over to Jerry.

        JERRY: Ohh, you got the jacket back.

        GEORGE: Ohh, yeahh.

        JERRY: (taking the jacket) Thank you.

        HALLIE: It got a little dirty, so they wanted to clean it before they 
        gave it
        back to you.

        JERRY: Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em.

        GEORGE: (smiling) That is really nice.

        HALLIE: Yeah.

        JERRY: Yeah.

        HALLIE: Yeah.

        JERRY: Yeah.

        GEORGE: This is nice.

        JERRY: Yeahh.

        HALLIE: Yeah.

        GEORGE: (forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have
        coffee.

        HALLIE: (flat) I'll see you at the wedding.

        Hallie walks away, leaving George's Gatsby ambitions in tatters.


        [Theatre]

        Elaine sits alone in the box. Something on the floor catches her eye. 
        It's
        Bob's hearing-aid earpiece. Elaine picks it up, and it occurs to her that 
        she
        has the opportunity she wanted. She wipes the earpiece on the lapel of 
        her
        jacket and carefully slips it over her ear. Elaine cocks her head on one
        side, listening to see if it makes a difference.


        [Theatre, Backstage]

        Jerry and George walk along backstage. Jerry has his jacket, and George 
        is
        carrying the Sandos Brother's jacket, looking sullen.

        GEORGE: (moody) Great! Now she's sour!

        JERRY: Maybe she'll sweeten.

        GEORGE: (angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!

        Behind Jerry and George, the Flying Sandos Brothers appear. They look 
        over
        toward Jerry and George.

        SANDOS BROTHER 1: (pointing) There they are!

        The Sandos Brothers set off running after Jerry and George. George hurriedly
        puts the jacket down on a table, as he and Jerry begin to hasten.

        GEORGE: Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!

        Jerry and George run away, as the Sandos Brothers advance.

        George is on the lead as he and Jerry reach a door marked 'Emergency Exit.
        Alarm will sound'. George pushes the door open and he and Jerry dart through.
        As they do, a loud alarm bell begins to ring.


        [Theatre]

        Elaine is sitting wearing the earpiece when the alarm sounds. Obviously, 
        the
        earpiece works, as Elaine spasms in pain at the ringing. She clutches 
        her
        hands to her ears and jerks off her seat, falling out of sight onto the 
        floor
        of the box.


        [Hallway, Apartment Building]

        Kramer stands outside the door to an apartment, flanked by two other guys.
        One of the guys knocks at the door. After a few seconds, it is opened 
        by
        Connie.

        KRAMER: (pointing) That's her, officer.

        CONNIE: (shocked) Kramer! Oh my god, I thought you were...

        KRAMER: (animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!

        The detective shows his shield to Connie.

        DETECTIVE: You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.

        CONNIE: (defensive) I didn't do anything.

        KRAMER: (sarcastic) Oh, yeah! Yeah!

        DETECTIVE: Get your coat, we gotta take you in.

        CONNIE: Can I call my lawyer?

        DETECTIVE: Okay, go ahead.

        Connie goes back into her apartment.


        [Connie's Apartment/Lawyer's Office]

        CONNIE: (on phone) You gotta meet me at the police station. They're arresting
        me for attempted murder.

        On the phone in his office is Jackie Chiles.

        JACKIE: Attempted murder? Of whom?

        CONNIE: This guy, Kramer.

        JACKIE: Oh. (hesitantly) Cosmo Kramer?

        CONNIE: (surprised) Yeah, that's right.

        JACKIE: (adamant) I don't want nothing to do with it.

        Jackie puts down his phone and looks glad to have escaped.

        [Montage of snippets]

        JERRY (V.O.): Last week on Seinfeld.

        A sequence of clips from The Bottle Deposit (1) establishes the story 
        
        so far:
        Newman and Kramer are using a USPS mail truck to run deposit bottles 
        and cans to Michigan, in order to collect 10 cents on each of them. George 
        has been 
        given an assignment by Mr Wilhelm, but he hasn't a clue what it is. Elaine 
        
        outbids Sue-Ellen Mishke at an auction, to buy John F Kennedy's golf clubs 
        on 
        behalf of Mr Peterman, and leaves them in the back of Jerry's car. Kramer 
        and 
        Newman have left groceries under the hood of Jerry's car, meaning Jerry 
        has to take 
        it to Tony the mechanic, who loves the car more than Jerry does. When 
        Jerry 
        asks for his car back, Tony flees in it, taking JFK's clubs with him.


        [Outside Auto Shop]

        Jerry and Elaine are outside the autoshop. Jerry is on the payphone.

        JERRY: Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)

        ELAINE: So? What'd they say?

        JERRY: They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.

        ELAINE: What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!

        JERRY: Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth 
        Whitehead, did I?

        ELAINE: What kind of maniac is this guy?

        JERRY: He's a very special maniac.

        ELAINE: What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.

        JERRY: I don't know.

        ELAINE: Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!


        [Elaine's Office]

        Elaine at her desk. Peterman enters.

        PETERMAN: Well, are they here?

        ELAINE: Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.

        PETERMAN: Snag?

        ELAINE: It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my 
        friend's car.

        PETERMAN: What does that have to do with my clubs?

        ELAINE: They happened to be in the back seat at the time.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry is talking with a police detective at his door.

        DETECTIVE: What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?

        JERRY: You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme 
        
        ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?

        DETECTIVE: All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, 
        thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm 
        gonna ask 
        you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think 
        it'll 
        help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?

        JERRY: Had I been taking...?

        DETECTIVE: Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? 
        
        Do you ride the clutch? Things like that.

        JERRY: W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I 
        want with it.

        The detective stares at Jerry.

        JERRY: Not that I would think of doing such things.

        DETECTIVE: (making a note) Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if 
        
        we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never end up 
        well.

        JERRY: Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.


        [Yankee Stadium: George's Office]

        George sits at his desk, his forehead resting on a folder he has 
        clutched in his hands. Mr Wilhelm enters, looking happy.

        GEORGE: (hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...

        WILHELM: That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. 
        (shakes George's hand) You really nailed it.

        GEORGE: I did?

        WILHELM: Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done 
        
        it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good 
        work 
        George.

        Wilhelm leaves. George looks stunned and confused.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        By now, George is looking much more pleased.

        JERRY: I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow 
        
        it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.

        GEORGE: Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it 
        
        was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea 
        
        who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? 
        Jimmy 
        crack corn and I don't care.


        [Mr Wilhelm's Home]

        Wilhelm sits on the couch. He has a newspaper and is talking to his 
        wife, who's in another room.

        WILHELM: The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't 
        
        he dear?

        MRS WILHELM (O.C.): You planted the rose bushes, dear.

        WILHELM: I did?


        MRS WILHELM (O.C.): Yesterday. You remember.

        WILHELM: (thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner?

        MRS WILHELM (O.C.): We just ate. Did you forget to take your medicine?

        Wilhelm can be seen struggling to recollect.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        A still pleased looking George is fetching a drink from Jerry's fridge.

        GEORGE: The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with 
        
        the car?

        JERRY: No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I 
        just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.

        GEORGE: Why not?

        JERRY: They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the 
        
        keys.

        The door opens and Elaine enters.

        ELAINE: (to George) Hey.

        GEORGE: Hey.

        ELAINE: (to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?

        JERRY: They're looking.

        GEORGE: I gotta go.

        George leaves. The phone rings and Jerry picks up.

        JERRY: Y'hello.

        DETECTIVE (V.O.): Mr Seinfeld?

        JERRY: Yeah.

        DETECTIVE (V.O.): It's Detective McMahon...

        Elaine looks quizzical. Jerry mouths, 'It's the police'

        DETECTIVE (V.O.): ...I'm at the warehouse on Pier 38. Ah, I think you'd 
        
        better get down here.

        JERRY: Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.

        ELAINE: (makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.

        JERRY: Are there golf clubs in the back?

        DETECTIVE (V.O.): We really can't tell. You better bring your service 
        
        records.


        [Pier 38 Warehouse]

        The interior of the warehouse is gloomy and dank. There are cars and 
        parts of cars arranged round the area, together with tools, welding gear, 
        etc. 
        Detective McMahon stands beside a car-shaped object hidden under a white 
        sheet. 
        Jerry and Elaine are led in by a young patrolman who looks queasy.

        YOUNG COP: Watch where you step. There's quite a bit of... grease. 
        Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.

        DETECTIVE: How d'you do. Thanks for coming down.

        JERRY: (indicating) This is Elaine Benes.

        ELAINE: (explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.

        DETECTIVE: I see.

        JERRY: Yeah.

        DETECTIVE: I'm sorry to make you go through this, but we need to make 
        
        sure.

        JERRY: Well, what's going on? What is this thing?

        DETECTIVE: One of our patrolmen stumbled over this.

        He lifts the sheet, revealing what's beneath to Jerry and Elaine.

        ELAINE: (horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)

        JERRY: Oh my God!

        The young patrolman removes his cap out of respect for the victim.

        DETECTIVE: The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams 
        
        thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap.

        ELAINE: Oh, my God.

        DETECTIVE: And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is 
        definitely ninety-two. The model is hard to determine because the drive 
        train is 
        all burnt out.

        JERRY: What is that smell?

        DETECTIVE: Look at the clutch.

        They look. Jerry and Elaine don't like what they see.

        ELAINE: Uuh.

        The patrolman cracks and leaves hurriedly, looking nauseous.

        YOUNG COP: Excuse me.

        DETECTIVE: Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it. I mean, they took 
        
        their time, they had fun. They were very systematic. They went out of 
        their 
        way to gouge the sides of every piston, and the turbo was separated from 
        the 
        housing and shoved right up the exhaust pipe.

        ELAINE: Uhh

        JERRY: Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.

        DETECTIVE: Your car's not a turbo?

        JERRY: No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a 
        turbo!

        ELAINE: (sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo.

        Elaine and Jerry hug in happiness. In the background, another woman 
        arrives.

        WOMAN: Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... 
        
        (voice breaking) midnight blue?

        DETECTIVE: (condolences) Yes ma'am.


        [Mail Truck]

        Newman drives as he and Kramer give voice to their happiness.

        KRAMER/NEWMAN: (singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine 
        bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine 
        bottles 
        and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in 
        five 
        hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle 
        and cans in 
        the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. 
        
        We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...

        Their singing ends shambolically as they lose track of the lyrics. But 
        
        the pair still look gleeful.


        [Jerry's Apartment/Jerry's car]

        The phone rings in Jerry's apartment. He picks it up.

        JERRY: Hello.

        TONY: Hey Jerry, it's Tony.

        JERRY: Tony, where are you?

        The Saab is driving down a quiet country road at night.

        TONY: Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her 
        
        all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's 
        nothing 
        to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you.

        Tony holds the phone toward the dash and revs the engine a little. 
        Jerry can hear the engine noise over the phone.

        JERRY: Tony, y-you better bring that car back!

        TONY: (angry) Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from 
        

        me, I don't forget that.

        JERRY: Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!

        TONY: Oh, your car. You want your car back!

        JERRY: Tony.

        TONY: Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But 
        this engine's running on my sweat and my blood.

        Tony hangs up the phone.

        JERRY: (exasperated) Where do I find these guys?


        [Mail Truck]

        Kramer is driving the truck along a highway in daylight.

        NEWMAN: How much gas we got?

        KRAMER: Three quarters of a tank.

        Newman punches the numbers into a calculator.

        KRAMER: That's better than we estimated.

        NEWMAN: (smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.

        They give a smug little laugh.

        NEWMAN: Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.

        KRAMER: Ah, no, that's not in the budget.

        NEWMAN: Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a 
        
        good investment.

        KRAMER: That's not a good investment, that's a loss.

        A convertible black Saab passes the mail truck.

        KRAMER: Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check 
        out that license plate.

        He accelerates the mail truck to close on the Saab, and leans forward, 
        
        straining to make out the plate.

        KRAMER: Yeah, those are New York plates.

        NEWMAN: Is that Jerry's number?

        KRAMER: I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are 
        
        pretty good odds.

        Kramer reaches under his seat, rummaging for something.

        NEWMAN: What're you doing?

        KRAMER: I'm calling Jerry.

        NEWMAN: On what?

        KRAMER: Brought my phone.

        He pulls out his mobile and hits the speed dial for Jerry.


        [Jerry's Apartment/Mail Truck]

        JERRY: (answering phone) Y'hello.

        KRAMER: Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?

        JERRY: Why, what's up?

        KRAMER: Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.

        JERRY: Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a 
        second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.

        KRAMER: (checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, 
        
        uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.

        JERRY: Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.

        KRAMER: Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.

        JERRY: Good work Kramer, this is incredible.

        KRAMER: Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on 
        
        a monkey! I'll check back with you.


        [Elaine's Office/Jerry's Apartment]

        The phone rings in Elaine's office. She answers it.

        ELAINE: Elaine Benes.

        JERRY: Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!

        ELAINE: Oh my god, where is it?

        JERRY: It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.

        ELAINE: Are the clubs there?

        JERRY: I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call 
        
        me back.

        ELAINE: Alright, I'm heading over right now.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Elaine enters at a rush.

        ELAINE: What's the status?

        JERRY: Last check-in, they were still on him.

        ELAINE: Well, have they called the police yet?

        JERRY: No, they won't call the police.

        ELAINE: What? Why not?

        JERRY: They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. 
        
        Kramer doesn't want a record.

        ELAINE: Kramer has a record.

        JERRY: Not a Federal record.

        The phone rings. Jerry grabs the handset by the couch, Elaine picks up 
        
        in the kitchen.


        [Mail Truck/Jerry's Apartment]

        ELAINE/JERRY: Kramer?

        JERRY: What's going on?

        KRAMER: Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.

        Ahead of the truck, the black Saab indicates his intention to move onto 
        
        the off-ramp.

        KRAMER: Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going 
        south on the one-thirty-five.

        ELAINE: Keep following him.

        KRAMER: Alright, alright, I'll follow him.

        NEWMAN: Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.

        KRAMER: Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our 
        
        way.

        ELAINE: I need those clubs.

        JERRY: Kramer, I want my car.

        KRAMER: Well, I don't know what to do.

        NEWMAN: Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy 
        
        could be going to Arkansas.

        JERRY: Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.

        NEWMAN: Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our 
        
        budget won't hold it.

        KRAMER: Well, I don't know what to do man!

        NEWMAN: Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.

        ELAINE/JERRY: Right. Go right!/South!

        KRAMER: Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.

        Kramer swerves onto the off-ramp at the last moment. Tyres squeal and 
        
        the truck sways.



        [Mail Truck]

        NEWMAN: I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole 
        
        venture.

        KRAMER: This ramp is steep.

        NEWMAN: All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.

        KRAMER: Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away 
        
        from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.

        Newman reaches across and takes the steering wheel as Kramer gets out 
        
        of the driving seat.

        NEWMAN: What're you doing?

        KRAMER: (climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get 
        something.

        NEWMAN: Are you crazy?

        The truck swerves as Newman slides into the driving seat.

        KRAMER: Keep your foot on the gas.

        Kramer shoves his way through the sackloads of bottles and cans.

        NEWMAN: Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?

        Kramer slides open the rear door of the truck.

        NEWMAN: Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our 
        losses.

        Kramer grabs a sack and heaves it out the back of the truck.

        KRAMER: Look out below!!

        Car horns can be heard as the sack lands in the carriageway. Kramer 
        grabs another sack and hurls that out, with another yelled warning.




        [Yankee Stadium: Steinbrenner's Office]

        Steinbrenner sits behind his desk. He's examining something on his 
        desktop with a large powerful magnifying glass.

        STEINBRENNER: (to himself) With this magnifying glass, I feel like a 
        scientist.

        There is a tap at the door, and George cautiously enters.

        GEORGE: You wanted to see me, sir?

        STEINBRENNER: Ah, come in George, come in.

        George strolls up to Big Stein's desk, looking more confident.

        STEINBRENNER: Uh, Wilhelm gave me this project you worked on.

        GEORGE: (smiling) Yes sir.

        STEINBRENNER: Let me ask you something, George. You having any personal 
        
        problems at home? Girl trouble, love trouble of any kind?

        GEORGE: (wondering where this is leading) No sir.

        STEINBRENNER: What about drugs? You doing some of that crack cocaine? 
        
        You on the pipe?

        GEORGE: (worried now) No sir.

        STEINBRENNER: Are you seeing a psychiatrist? Bcause I got a flash for 
        
        you young man, you're non compos mentis! You got some bats in the belfry!

        GEORGE: What're.. What're you talking about?

        STEINBRENNER: George, I've read this report. It's very troubling, very 
        
        troubling indeed. It's a sick mind at work here.

        Two burly guys who are clearly medical orderlies come into the room 
        behind George.

        STEINBRENNER: Okay, come on boys, come on in here. George, this is Herb 
        
        and Dan.

        George regards the two guys, very nervously as they approach him and 
        stand behind him, one on either shoulder.

        STEINBRENNER: They're gonna take you away to a nice place where you can 
        
        get some help. They're very friendly people there. My brother-in-law was 
        there 
        for a couple of weeks. The man was obsessed with lactating women. They 
        
        completely cured him, although he still eats a lot of cheese.

        Herb and Dan take hold of George's arms. George gets panicky.

        GEORGE: Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not 
        
        mine.

        Herb and Dan begin to drag the struggling George across the office 
        toward the door.

        STEINBRENNER: Of course you didn't George. Of course you didn't write 
        
        it.

        GEORGE: I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got 
        
        done, but it did.

        As Herb and Dan haul George through the door, George makes his last 
        stand, trying to get a hold on the doorframe with his feet. Eventually 
        he is 
        dragged out into the corridor and vanishes from view.

        STEINBRENNER: Of course. Of course it got done. Things get done all the 
        
        time, I understand. (as George disappears) Don't worry, your job'll be 
        waiting 
        for you when you get back. (banging his fist on his desk) Get better George. 
        
        Get better!


        [Mail Truck]

        The Saab travels down a quiet country road at night, followed by the 
        mail truck. Kramer is driving, Newman looks furious in the passenger seat.

        KRAMER: (frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every 
        
        bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...

        He looks across at the substantial bulk of Newman and a thought occurs.

        KRAMER: ...sluggish.

        NEWMAN: I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? 
        
        What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.

        KRAMER: Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?

        NEWMAN: (perks up) A pie stand? Where?

        KRAMER: Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.

        NEWMAN: Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.

        Kramer pulls the truck into the roadside. As it halts, Newman sticks 
        his head out the window to peer back down the road.

        NEWMAN: Where? I..I..I don't see it.

        KRAMER: Well open the door, you get a better look.

        Newman slides back the door and leans out.

        NEWMAN: I don't see any pie...

        Kramer plants his foot firmly in Newman's backside and heaves him out 
        
        of the truck.

        NEWMAN: ...Aargh!

        As Newman lands heavily in the verge, Kramer slides the door shut and 
        
        drives away.

        NEWMAN: Kramer!!

        KRAMER: I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.

        NEWMAN: (after speeding truck) Kramer!!

        In the mail truck, Kramer picks up his phone and redials.

        KRAMER: (shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running 
        lean. We're back on track, buddy!


        [Country Roadside]


        Newman wanders forlornly along the roadside at night. He tries to thumb 
        
        a ride from passing traffic, displaying his uniform insignia to drivers.

        NEWMAN: Federal employee. Federal employee.

        Aside from a few blaring car horns, he gets no response. He continues 
        
        his trudge, a sour look on his face.

        [Countryside]

        Newman struggles up a steep slope.

        Newman pushes his way through a field of crops. He emerges from the 
        vegetation and sees a farmhouse, its lights blazing. His face lights up. 
        He 
        stumbles towards the welcoming lights, tripping and falling, before picking 
        
        himself up and running up to the building.

        [Farm]

        Newman reaches the steps to the porch and stumbles up them. As he 
        reaches the door, a scent catches his attention. Looking to the window, 
        he sees a 
        pie left out on the window sill to cool. A craftier look comes to his 
        face. He 
        turns back to the door and knocks. After a few seconds, it opens.

        FARMER: Hello stranger.

        NEWMAN: (a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but 
        
        I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of 
        
        backwoods mail-hating survivalists.

        FARMER: Calm down, now. Calm down. Don't worry, we'll take care of you. 
        
        This farm ain't much, but uh, you're welcome to what we have. Hot bath, 
        
        hearty meal, clean bed.

        NEWMAN: Oh, thank you, sir.

        FARMER: Just have one rule. Keep your hands off my daughter.

        Just then, the daughter in question slinks up behind the farmer. 
        Blonde, twenty-ish, just one walking temptation.


        [Mail Truck/Jerry's Apartment]

        Kramer has the mail truck right behind Jerry's Saab as they race along 
        
        a quiet country road.

        KRAMER: Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's 
        
        running scared, buddy.

        Jerry and Elaine are sitting on the couch, each with a phone handset.

        JERRY: How's the gas situation?

        KRAMER: (checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.

        In front of him, Tony reaches into the back seat of the Saab.

        KRAMER: He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.

        Tony extracts a long, metallic object from behind himself.

        KRAMER: He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!

        JERRY: Duck, Kramer! Duck!

        Kramer crouches as far as he can. Tony flings the object at Kramer's 
        mail truck. It crashes against the windshield and bounces away.

        KRAMER: It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!

        ELAINE: Those are JFK's golf clubs!

        Tony hurls another club at the mail truck. Again, it bounces off the 
        windshield, leaving some cracks.

        KRAMER: Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy 
        
        fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!

        ELAINE: Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!

        JERRY: No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.

        KRAMER: Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, 
        he's taking out the woods!

        Tony flings a heavy wood at the truck.

        KRAMER: (noise)

        The Saab leads the truck down the road, with Tony hurling club after 
        club over his shoulder and into the front of the truck.

        KRAMER: (yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!

        Tony hurls the golf bag at the truck. It slams solidly against the 
        windshield, Kramer flinches, the truck swerves. The front wheel runs over 
        a club on 
        the tarmac and the tyre bursts.

        JERRY: (hearing the noises) What's happening!

        The truck is rattling and lurching as it struggles along the road.

        KRAMER: This truck is dying. We're losing him.

        The Saab easily outpaces the truck and accelerates away. The truck 
        staggers to a halt, giving out a death rattle. A cloud of steam and smoke 
        erupts from 
        under the hood.

        KRAMER: I think we lost him.

        JERRY: (disappointment) Dammit!

        ELAINE: (quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?

        KRAMER: (subdued) Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em.

        Jerry hangs up.


        [Country]

        Kramer climbs out of the truck and looks back down the road. He kicks 
        
        the deflated tyre. Coming to the front of the truck, he picks a club off 
        
        the front bumper and pulls the broken shaft of another out of the radiator 
        
        grille.

        Kramer walks along the road with the bent and broken clubs. He comes 
        upon the bag and transfers the clubs into it. Slinging it over his shoulder, 
        he 
        continues on his way, picking up more battered golf clubs as he goes.

        [Farm]

        Newman, the farmer and the farmer's daughter sit round the kitchen 
        table. They are working their way through a generous meal.

        FARMER: Enjoy that mutton?

        NEWMAN: (mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta 
        
        sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.

        The farmer's daughter is staring at Newman and toying with her fork, 
        touching it to her lips and teeth. (It's difficult to be arousing with 
        cutlery, but 
        she's giving it a pretty good shot.) Newman notices this and tries to 
        take a
        nonchalant sip from a glass, but it goes down the wrong way and he 
        splutters.

        FARMER: That cider too strong for you?

        NEWMAN: No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's 
        benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.

        The farmer's daughter licks her lips.

        FARMER: Gonna be milking Holsteins in the morning, if you'd like to 
        lend a hand.

        NEWMAN: (reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. 
        
        I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.

        FARMER: Ahh, Susie here'll teach you.

        The farmer's daughter goes wide eyed.

        FARMER: Just gotta pull on the teat a little.

        Susie and Newman half-laugh nervously.

        SUSIE: (suggestive) Nice having a big, strong, man around.

        NEWMAN: You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I 
        Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)

        The farmer looks at him oddly.

        NEWMAN: (breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?



        [Institution]

        George is using a payphone in the corner of the room. His free hand is 
        
        holding the waistband of his trousers. In the background are a couple 
        of 
        inmates and visitors, and an orderly. Notable among them are Pop and Deena 
        Lazzari,
        previously seen in 'The Gum'.

        GEORGE: (desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!

        DEENA: I'll be back same time next week, Pop.

        GEORGE: (quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing 
        
        to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just 
        tell 'em 
        what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.

        Deena spots George as she makes her way out of the room.

        DEENA: George?

        George looks like his salvation has arrived. He hangs up the phone.

        DEENA: I see you're finally getting some help.

        GEORGE: Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're 
        
        here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm 
        okay. 
        You know that I don't belong in here.

        DEENA: George, this is the best thing for you. (she walks away)

        GEORGE: Yea... (sinks in) What? No, no!

        As he tries to follow Deena, the orderly grabs hold of him and 
        restrains him.

        GEORGE: Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!

        George is almost in tears and hops from foot to foot in frustration as 
        
        the orderly holds him. Pop Lazzari wanders over.

        POP: Is that little Georgie C? How's the folks? You still got that nice 
        
        little car?


        [Countryside]

        Kramer approaches a familiar farmhouse. As he mounts the steps up to 
        the porch, a commotion erupts inside the place. A gunshot rings out and 
        the 
        farmer's daughter screams. Kramer flinches. The farmer can be heard yelling 
        
        angrily. The door is flung open and Newman runs out pulling up his trousers.

        NEWMAN: (screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah!

        KRAMER: What you doing?!

        NEWMAN: (pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!

        Newman sets off running. From the door of the farmhouse comes the 
        farmer, armed with a shotgun, closely followed by his daughter, whose 
        shirt is undone 
        and hair is dishevelled.

        KRAMER: (takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!

        FARMER: (taking aim) I told you to keep away from my daughter!

        As Kramer and Newman reach the edge of the crops, the farmer fires a 
        shot. Both Newman and Kramer leap in the air and run into the cover of 
        the crop. 
        Before the farmer can fire again, his daughter pushes the barrel of the 
        shotgun 
        downward, spoiling his aim.

        SUSIE: No daddy, you'll hurt him! I love him! (waving after Newman) 
        Goodbye Norman, goodbye.


        [Elaine's Office]

        Elaine is sitting with her head in her hands. Peterman enters at a 
        rush.

        PETERMAN: (excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. 
        
        Where are they?

        ELAINE: (not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr 
        Peterman.

        PETERMAN: Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other 
        than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded 
        only 
        by her proclivity to procreate.

        Elaine puts the bag of clubs down beside Peterman. The clubs are, of 
        course, wrecked. Elaine looks like she's expecting a poor reaction. Peterman 
        
        picks up a club or two, staring in disbelief at the twisted metal.

        ELAINE: The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.

        PETERMAN: Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.

        ELAINE: (spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing 
        
        worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)

        PETERMAN: See you on Monday.

        Peterman picks up the bag and heads for the door.

        ELAINE: Have a good game.

        [First scene.
        The cemetery. Jerry, George, and the Rosses are standing in front of Susan's 
        tombstone, which reads "Susan Biddle Ross, June 8, 1964 - May 19, 
        1996."]

        George: Well... it's a magnificent stone.

        Mr. Ross: They put it up this morning.

        [pause.]

        George: It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?

        [Jerry, obviously uncomfortable, turns slowly and shrugs his shoulders 
        at George.]

        Mrs. Ross: George... we'll leave you alone with her.

        George: What?

        Mrs. Ross: I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.

        [She pats his shoulder, and then she and her husband leave Jerry and George 
        alone with Susan.]

        George: No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.

        [Jerry turns around to follow the Rosses.]

        George: Jerry...

        [He tries to keep Jerry there, but Jerry jerks away. George then turns 
        to Susan's stone nervously, trying to think of where to begin. Meanwhile, 
        Mrs. Ross offers Jerry an alcoholic beverage of some sort.]

        Jerry: Thank you, no.

        [She continues drinking.]

        George: (to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, 
        we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie 
        nervously) So... yeah.

        [New scene.
        Jerry's apartment.]

        George: Boy, that was awkward!

        Jerry: I don't mind the cemetery.

        George: What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?

        Jerry: Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow 
        of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.

        George: What is that?

        Jerry: Star Trek II.

        George: (identifying it) Wrath of Khan!

        Jerry: Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him 
        up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big 
        sunglasses case.

        George: That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...

        Jerry: Yeah...

        [For a brief moment, the two become overwhelmed with emotion.]

        George: Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess 
        that's it.

        Jerry: So it's over?

        George: I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody 
        could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.

        Jerry: All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?

        George: Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!

        [Kramer enters as George is leaving.]

        Kramer: Movie?

        Jerry: Yeah, you in?

        Kramer: No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.

        George: George is going to the movies! (exits)

        Jerry: (to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?

        Kramer: (pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. 
        The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.

        Jerry: ...But with punching and kicking.

        Kramer: Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here 
        (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle 
        with his hands).

        Jerry: Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.

        Kramer: What, she's been away?

        Jerry: She's been in Mexico for six weeks.

        Kramer: No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks 
        the other day.

        Jerry: That was July 4th!

        [Kramer pauses to think.]

        Jerry: Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see 
        you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes 
        similar circle with his hands).

        [New scene.
        The coffee shop.]

        Elaine: It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all 
        on Peterman's peso.

        Jerry: Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?

        Elaine: Oh, tons!

        Jerry: Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos 
        and watching Viva Zapata?

        Elaine: (laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?

        Jerry: No, I don't.

        Elaine: So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?

        Jerry: My what?

        Elaine: Jeannie... your fiancee.

        Jerry: Oh, yeah, that. Well...

        Elaine: All right. Spill it, Jerome.


        Jerry: There's really not that much to tell.

        [flashback sequence of Jerry and Jeannie at the coffee shop begins as 
        Jerry narrates.]

        "About a month ago, we were here having lunch, when all of a sudden 
        we both just blurted out..."

        Jerry & Jeannie: (simultaneously) I hate you!

        [They both chuckle over the coincidence.]

        Jeannie: See ya.

        Jerry: See ya.

        [Jeannie returns her ring to Jerry, who puts it in his pocket.]

        "It was unprecendented. I mean, it was the first truly mutual breakup 
        in relationship history."

        [flashback ends.]

        Jerry: (continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.

        Elaine: You've never felt remorse.

        Jerry: I know, I feel bad about that...

        Elaine: I bet your parents were upset, huh?

        Jerry: Eh.

        Elaine: You haven't told them yet, have you?

        Jerry: No.

        [New scene.
        J. Peterman's office.]

        Dugan: "So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering 
        waters of Lake Victoria..."

        J. Peterman: Oh, for the love of God, man! Just tell me what the product 
        is.

        Dugan: It's a, uh, washcloth.

        J. Peterman: No washcloths!

        Elaine: Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It 
        combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like 
        to call it the Urban Sombrero.

        J. Peterman: (rubbing his neck) Oh, my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist.

        Elaine: Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?

        J. Peterman: Yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on.

        Elaine: Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's 
        the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.

        [Peterman walks out, groaning.]

        Elaine: Mr. Peterman?

        [New scene.
        The street.]

        George: (inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something 
        I haven't felt in a long time.

        Jerry: Pride?

        George: No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.

        Jerry: Well, you're your own boss now.

        George: I wanna go to a tractor pull.

        Jerry: Go ahead.

        George: I am staying out all night!

        Jerry: Who's stopping you?

        George: I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like 
        it's an apple.

        Jerry: Whatever.

        [Jerry sees someone he knows.]

        Jerry: Oh God.

        George: What?

        Jerry: It's Dolores.

        George: Who?

        Jerry: Mulva.

        [Dolores notices Jerry.]

        Dolores: Jerry, hi.

        Jerry: Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?

        George: Dolores!

        Dolores: Hi. (to Jerry) I heard you got engaged.

        Jerry: Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.

        Dolores: Oh, that's too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. 
        See ya.

        Jerry: See ya.

        George: Bye, Dolores.

        [Dolores walks away.]

        George: I thought Mulva hated you.

        Jerry: Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've 
        shown I can go all the way.

        George: All the way?

        Jerry: Not our "all the way", their "all the way." 
        I got the stink of responsibility on me.

        George: Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for 
        a year.

        Jerry: You stink worse than I do!

        George: I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!

        [New scene.
        J. Peterman's office.]

        Secretary: Elaine, it's Mr. Peterman on the phone.

        Elaine: (answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?

        J. Peterman: Elaine, I'll be blunt. I'm burnt out. I'm fried. My mind 
        is as barren as the surface of the moon. I can run that catalog no longer.

        Elaine: What? Well, who's gonna do it?

        J. Peterman: What about you?

        Elaine: Me? Why me?

        J. Peterman: Why, indeed.

        Elaine: Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.

        J. Peterman: I've already left, Elaine. I'm in Burma.

        Elaine: Burma?

        J. Peterman: You most likely know it as Myanmar, but it will always be 
        Burma to me. Bonne chance, Elaine. (to a passerby) You there on the motorbike! 
        Sell me one of your melons! (runs after him)

        [The phone is not hung up.]

        Elaine: Mr. Peterman?

        [New scene.
        Jerry's apartment.]

        Jerry: Where?

        Elaine: Burma.

        Jerry: Isn't it Myanmar now?

        Elaine: Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be 
        in charge!

        Jerry: No, certainly not.

        Elaine: I mean, I can't give people orders!

        Jerry: No one's gonna listen to you.

        Elaine: I am not qualified to run the catalog!

        Jerry: You're not qualified to work at the catalog.

        [Elaine groans in frustration as Kramer enters.]

        Kramer: Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?


        Elaine: Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the 
        catalog.

        Kramer: Where?

        Jerry: Myanmar.

        Kramer: The discount pharmacy?

        Elaine: Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.

        Kramer: Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, 
        is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? 
        (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his 
        head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, 
        let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...

        Elaine: Karate?

        Kramer: Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, 
        no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My 
        legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my 
        katra.

        Elaine: Katra?

        Kramer: Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, 
        "Yes, I can!"

        Jerry: Sammy Davis had it.

        Kramer: So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating 
        the dojo. I'm class champion.

        Elaine: Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.

        Kramer: Sure you have.

        Elaine: I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. 
        I can do that.

        Kramer: You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to 
        the door) Now get out of here.

        Elaine: (excitedly) Okay.

        [Kramer slams the door behind her.]

        Kramer: That kid is gonna be all right.

        Jerry: No, she's not.

        [There's a knock at Jerry's door.]

        Joey: Come on, Kramer!

        Kramer: Hey there.

        Joey: Come on. Mom's down in the car.

        Kramer: Okay, Joey.

        [Joey exits.]

        Jerry: You guys both have class at the same time?

        Kramer: No, we're in the same class.

        Jerry: What do you mean you're in the same class?

        Kramer: He almost beat me.

        Jerry: Kramer, you're fighting children?!

        Kramer: We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.

        Jerry: He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring 
        his neck!

        [Car horn honks.]

        Kramer: I got carpool. (exits)

        [New scene.
        Kramer's carpool.]

        Kramer: Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.

        Joey: Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom?

        Mrs. Zanfino: Mmm, I don't know...

        [The kids begin pleading, so Kramer joins in.]

        Mrs. Zanfino: All right.

        Kids & Kramer: Yay!

        [New scene.
        J. Peterman's office. Elaine has called in all her new employees.]

        Dugan: *You're* taking the job?

        Elaine: You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of 
        you by 6:00. No, make that six ideas by 4:00. All right, let's move, move, 
        move, move, move!

        [As everyone rushes out, Elaine laughs, amazed at the new power she now 
        holds.]

        [New scene.
        Kramer's karate class.]

        Sensei: Are you prepared for kumite?

        Kramer & Joey: Yes, sensei.

        Sensei: Fight stance.

        [Kramer & Joey assume fight stance.]

        Sensei: Hydjama! Begin!

        [Kramer then frantically makes several karate hand motions, intimidating 
        Joey. What follows is a montage of sequences featuring Kramer challenging 
        his class. He grabs an opponent by the foot and flips him over; knocks 
        one out with a simple karate chop to the head; has another turned upside 
        down being shaken violently; drags another along the floor; and chases 
        several at once.]

        Sensei: (raising Kramer's arm) Winner!

        [The other kids bow their heads in disgrace.]

        [New scene.
        George's apartment, in a very cluttered state. George is walking around 
        in nothing but boxers, humming to himself while carrying a soda and a 
        block of cheese. There's a knock at his door.]

        George: It's open!

        [As George plops onto the sofa, the Rosses enter.]

        George: (surprised) Rosses.

        Mrs. Ross: Hello, George.

        George: Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch 
        of newspapers and crumbs)

        Mr. Ross: We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.

        George: Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? 
        (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)

        Mrs. Ross: We know the last three months have been hard on you.

        George: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.

        Mr. Ross: And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when 
        parents outlive their children.

        George: Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.

        Mr. Ross: That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's 
        memory.

        George: Oh, that's wonderful.

        Mr. Ross. And, of course, we want you to be an integral part.

        George: Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?

        Mr. Ross: You'll be on the board of directors.

        George: (feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, 
        it's just... my duties with the Yankees...

        Mrs. Ross: Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your 
        schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.

        George: I can't believe this is happening.

        Mr. Ross: Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational 
        words. He said to us, "She's not really dead if her shadow is..." 
        Uh, w-what was it, dear?

        Mrs. Ross: Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell 
        knows?

        Mr. Ross: Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan 
        doesn't have to end.

        Mrs. Ross: So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?

        George: (feigning happiness) The second I see him.

        [New scene.
        The coffee shop. Jerry is having lunch when George walks in.]


        Jerry: Hey.

        George: Hey. How's your day, good?

        Jerry: Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.

        George: So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?

        Jerry: Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?

        George: What was that line again? Something about finding your way in 
        a shadow?

        Jerry: No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way 
        to remember her."

        George: That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee 
        and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.

        Jerry: (stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?

        George: The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to 
        sit on the board of directors.

        Jerry: Hey, board of directors. Look at you!

        George: Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! 
        I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car 
        battery!

        Jerry: Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing 
        it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor 
        paradise.

        George: Don't you see? I'm back in.

        Jerry: All because of Wrath of Khan?

        George: Yes!

        Jerry: Well, it was the best of those movies.

        [The camera is over George's head and spins around repeatedly as George 
        screams.]

        George: KHAN!

        [New scene.
        The foundation. George is staring intently at a painting of Susan as Wyck 
        walks in.]

        Wyck: George.

        [George doesn't respond.]

        Wyck: George. (taps him on the shoulder)

        George: (startled) Oh!

        Wyck: I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.

        George: Wink.

        Wyck: (correcting him) Wyck.

        George: Wyck.

        Wyck: Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.

        George: Oh. I know they have some monies.

        Wyck: They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned 
        to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.

        George: So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... 
        then we--

        Wyck: Yes.

        George: And now?

        Wyck: Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.

        George: This townhouse?

        Wyck: This would have been your wedding gift.

        George: And now?

        Wyck: Not.

        George: Not.

        Wyck: Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't 
        be easy.

        George: You know, it really can't.

        [New scene.
        The coffee shop.]

        Mulva: So who broke it off?

        Jerry: Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.

        Mulva: Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual 
        breakup. Tell me the truth.

        Jerry: I am. It was the world's first.

        Mulva: You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought *maybe* you had 
        matured. But obviously there's no growth here. (exits)

        Jerry: Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... 
        (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!

        [New scene.
        Jerry's apartment. The phone is ringing as he's getting in.]

        Jerry: (answering) Hello?

        Secretary: Please hold for Elaine Benes.

        Jerry: Oh, I don't believe this.

        Elaine: (picking up) Jerry!

        Jerry: Hey!

        Elaine: Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the 
        J. Peterman Catalog.

        Jerry: How's it look?

        Elaine: (muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.

        Jerry: Huh?

        Elaine: I say, it's a peach.

        Jerry: Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was 
        mutual, did you believe me?

        Elaine: No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't 
        be selling it.

        Jerry: I gotta do some research here.

        Elaine: Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always 
        thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did 
        not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.

        Jerry: Oh, I'm the doofus?

        Elaine: Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.

        Jerry: You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.

        Elaine: Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.

        Jerry: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

        [New scene.
        Kramer's karate class. Kramer is beating his opponent, a little girl. 
        Elaine walks in, surprised.]

        Elaine: Kramer!

        Kramer: Oh, hey.

        Elaine: What are you doing?

        Kramer: Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.

        Elaine: You never said you were fighting children.

        Kramer: Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the 
        ferocity.

        Elaine: This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all 
        that stupid katra stuff?

        Kramer: No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.

        Elaine: Search... for Spock?!

        Kramer: Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the 
        better picture, but for me, I always...

        Elaine: (pushes him) You doofus!

        [As Kramer is knocked down, there is amazed murmuring among his peers.]

        [New scene.
        The coffee shop. Jerry is conducting some research.]

        Jerry: Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another 
        man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start 
        over here this time.


        Waitress #1: More.

        Waitress #2: Less.

        Ruthie: Same.

        Willie: Are we about through here?

        [Jerry crosses off something on his clipboard.]

        [New scene.
        A dark, foggy street. Kramer is walking with Joey.]

        Kramer: I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.

        Joey: She had a little change of plans.

        [Children emerge from various places in the alley, to ambush Kramer.]

        Kramer: What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout 
        we had tonight, huh?

        Girl: Now we finish it.

        [Kramer tries to escape up the fire escape ladder, but the kids drag him 
        down.]

        Kramer: Aah! Aah! Mama!

        [New scene.
        Jerry's apartment.]

        Jerry: (on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that 
        pond out in front of the condo.

        [Elaine enters.]

        Jerry: Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, 
        I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)

        [The phone rings again expectedly. Jerry hangs up without answering.]

        Jerry: So... did you stop by the dojo?

        Elaine: Yep.

        Jerry: How's your confidence level?

        Elaine: Shot.

        Jerry: Self-esteem?

        Elaine: Gone.

        Jerry: Doofus?

        Elaine: (raises her hand) Yo.

        Jerry: All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?

        [Elaine takes out the Urban Sombrero and puts it on.]

        Jerry: What is that?

        Elaine: It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.

        Jerry: Well, nobody sees the... cover.

        [Kramer enters.]

        Kramer: God!

        Jerry: What happened to you?

        Kramer: Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little 
        eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) 
        What is that?

        Jerry: It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. 
        Let's congratulate her.

        Kramer: Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!

        Elaine: (pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your 
        fault! You told me I could run the company!

        Kramer: Well, then I was way off!

        Elaine: Well, I'll see ya... (exits)

        Jerry: Vaya con dios.

        Kramer: (with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You 
        and George going out a little later?

        Jerry: No, he's still stuck at the foundation.

        Kramer: You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.

        Jerry: Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)

        [New scene.
        The foundation.]

        Wyck: Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That 
        should fetch a fair price.

        George: Would I have had access to that?

        Wyck: Of course, it would have been yours.

        George: And now?

        [Wyck turns to face him.]

        George: (anticipating the answer) Not.

        [phone rings. George eagerly answers it.]

        George: Hello?

        Jerry: Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. 
        Your story's the one.

        George: My story?

        Jerry: Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons 
        give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?

        George: Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?

        Wyck: (chuckling) Oh, no, not even close.

        George: (remorsefully) I can't go.

        Jerry: What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting 
        at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!

        [George hangs up.]

        Wyck: Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value: $2.6 
        million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?

        [George turns to the portrait of Susan in amazement.]

        Opening scene - George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.

        GEORGE: You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!

        WYCK:     Well, we think it would be a nice touch 
        for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?

        GEORGE: I like, uh...<mutters something unintelligible under his breath.>

        WYCK: Pardon?

        GEORGE: <mutters it again>

        WYCK: Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the 
        time of her unfortunate <clears his throat>...accident.

        <George looks at Wyck suspiciously.>


        New scene - George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.

        JERRY: He cleared his throat?

        GEORGE: Yes!

        JERRY: So?

        GEORGE: He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident." 
        

        JERRY: Not getting it.

        GEORGE: Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he 
        thinks I killed Susan!

        JERRY: Oh, help me, Rhonda.

        GEORGE: What time is it?

        JERRY (looks at his watch): 1:15.

        GEORGE: Right now?

        JERRY: I gotta go meet Pam.

        GEORGE: Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?

        JERRY: Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.

        GEORGE: Where's Elaine?

        JERRY: She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have 
        kids now?

        GEORGE: What's with all these people having babies?

        JERRY: Perpetuation of the species. 

        GEORGE: Yeah! Right!

        JERRY: By the way, just for the record -

        GEORGE: No, I did not! <They exit the coffee shop.>


        Commercial break.

        New scene - Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.

        CAROL: ...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!

        ELAINE: Well, that's...that's sweet.

        GAIL: Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.

        CAROL: Elaine, you gotta have a baby!

        ELAINE: Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney 
        Greengrass the other day...

        LISA: Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.

        ELAINE: I really like the city.

        CAROL: The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?

        ELAINE: Uh, it was in the Hamptons.

        CAROL: Oh! I have pictures!

        ELAINE: No, no, that's okay, it's uh...

        CAROL (shows Elaine and the girls pictures of Adam): Look at him! Just 
        look at him!

        <Elaine is revolted by the sight of "breathtaking" little 
        Adam.>


        New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.

        JERRY: So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had 
        the other day...

        GEORGE: Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?

        JERRY: You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try 
        the old Jerry Lewis trick?

        GEORGE: Jerry Lewis?

        JERRY: I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully 
        leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, 
        he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.

        GEORGE: That's pretty paranoid.

        JERRY: Yes, it is.

        GEORGE: I like it!

        JERRY: I thought you might.


        New scene - Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.

        PAM: Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. <Kramer is smitten with Pam 
        and grins goofily.> Jerry's told me a lot about you. <Kramer continues 
        grinning.> Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work 
        in a bookstore.

        KRAMER (mouths the words): Books. <Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the 
        counter.>

        PAM: Oh, careful! <Jerry enters.>

        JERRY: Hi, sorry I'm late.

        PAM: That's okay. Kramer let me in. 

        JERRY: You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.

        PAM: Okay. <Touches Kramer's hand> It was really nice meeting you.

        <Jerry and Pam leave. Kramer sniffs his hand where Pam touched him, 
        and makes a delighted noise.>


        New scene - Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.

        KRAMER: I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.

        NEWMAN: Go on.

        KRAMER: Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.


        NEWMAN: Ah, yes. Forbidden love.

        KRAMER: She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.

        NEWMAN: "Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite 
        fetching.

        KRAMER: I can't even speak in front of her. <Sits down on the couch.>

        NEWMAN: Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? <Walks in front 
        of Kramer and trips over his feet.>

        KRAMER: She has delicate beauty.

        NEWMAN: Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over 
        the head.

        KRAMER: And yet, he's my friend.

        NEWMAN: And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that 
        there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom 
        we are put on this earth.

        KRAMER: Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.

        NEWMAN: One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, 
        workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. 
        For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear 
        I will never possess.

        KRAMER: I thought we were talking about me.

        NEWMAN: Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.

        KRAMER: Confront Jerry? I can't.

        NEWMAN: You must!

        KRAMER: I won't!

        NEWMAN: You will!


        New scene - Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.

        ELAINE (to Jerry, imitating Carol): "Elaine, ya gotta have a baby." 
        Ugh. 

        GEORGE: Where are all the poetry magazines?

        ELAINE: The New Yorker has poetry.

        GEORGE: Yes. The New Yorker.

        JERRY: Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?

        ELAINE: They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some 
        kind of talent.

        JERRY: C'mon, you want to have a baby.

        ELAINE: Why? Because I can? 

        JERRY: It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, 
        the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. 
        You think you're any better?

        ELAINE: Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!

        KEVIN: I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying. 

        ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry.

        KEVIN: No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having 
        babies.

        ELAINE: Yeah, like you must procreate.

        KEVIN: Besides, anyone can do it.

        ELAINE: Oh, it's been done to death. <smiles>


        New scene - George in another meeting at the Foundation. He has a briefcase 
        with a tape recorder in it.

        GEORGE: I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.

        WYCK: Are you okay, George?

        GEORGE: No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days 
        and bad. <Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.> Some 
        days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking 
        those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. <Gets up 
        and leaves the meeting.>

        <George is shown standing on the street while the tape rolls inside 
        the briefcase.>

        Cut back to the Foundation meeting.

        WYCK: ...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... <George 
        returns and retrieves the briefcase.>

        GEORGE (apologetic): Briefcase. <Shrugs and exits.>


        New scene - Elaine and Kevin at the coffee shop.

        ELAINE: So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?

        KEVIN: Not at all. 

        ELAINE: 'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a 
        pretty good humanitarian. <Waitress comes to the table and pours more 
        coffee.> You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. <To 
        Kevin> Right? Am I right? <Kramer walks by.> Kramer. Kramer! 
        Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. <Kramer and Kevin shake hands.> 
        Oh, you got a little, uh...

        KRAMER (wipes chocolate off his face): Oh, I just had two double-fudge 
        sundaes.

        ELAINE: Oh. Are you alright?

        KRAMER: Yeah, I'll be okay.

        ELAINE: You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.

        KRAMER: Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.

        ELAINE: Oh, no...that won't last.

        KRAMER: What do you mean?

        ELAINE: He's not ga-ga.

        <Kramer suddenly looks elated and runs out.>


        New scene - George shows up at Jerry's apartment later that night with 
        the briefcase.

        GEORGE: Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some 
        of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! 
        <Notices that the briefcase is damaged.> Look at this - what the 
        hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.

        JERRY: How long did you leave it up there?

        GEORGE: Five minutes. What the hell happened here?

        JERRY: Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.

        GEORGE: I have to rewind it first. <George presses the rewind button 
        on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as 
        it rewinds.> Alright, alright. 

        <George plays back the tape. We hear a voice ask, "Did anyone 
        notice George's fingernails?" Then a female voice answering, "Oh 
        my, yes. They looked like they were eaten away by weavels." The male 
        voice remarks, "It's warm in here. Open a window." Then, "Hey! 
        What are you doing?" The female voice exclaims, "Dear God." 
        There's a clunking sound on the tape, and the recording ends.>

        JERRY: Is that it?

        GEORGE: Stopped dead.

        JERRY: What do you make of it?

        GEORGE: I don't know. <George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.>

        KRAMER: Jerry. Uh, can we talk?

        GEORGE (to Kramer): Kinda busy here.

        KRAMER: I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.

        GEORGE: Why can't I stay?

        KRAMER: Because it doesn't concern you.

        GEORGE: Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. <Kramer grabs 
        the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes 
        the door.>

        JERRY: So, what's on your mind?

        KRAMER: It's Pam.

        JERRY: Pam? What about Pam?

        KRAMER: I love her, Jerry!

        JERRY: You what?

        KRAMER: I love her! 


        JERRY: Is that right?

        KRAMER: Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry 
        it in the pan.

        JERRY: What does that mean?

        KRAMER: Oh, and that voice! 

        JERRY: What about her name?

        KRAMER: Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. <Kramer sits on the couch.> 
        Pam. Pam. Pam!

        JERRY: She's got really nice hair.

        KRAMER: Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip 
        with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.

        JERRY: You've got really specific tastes.

        KRAMER: Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.

        JERRY: She's got nice calves.

        KRAMER: Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...

        JERRY: Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.

        KRAMER: No you can't, Jerry.

        JERRY: But I might. 

        KRAMER: Oh, no you don't.

        JERRY: Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon? 

        KRAMER: What...?

        JERRY: I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!

        KRAMER (frantic): Huh?

        JERRY: Pam!

        KRAMER: Huh?

        JERRY: Pam!

        KRAMER: Huh-yah! <Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is 
        still sitting in the hallway on a chair.>


        Commercial break.

        New scene - Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.

        KRAMER: So now he wants her more than ever!

        NEWMAN: Blast!

        KRAMER: What am I gonna do, huh?

        NEWMAN: Don't despair, my friend. <Newman walks in front of Kramer 
        and trips over his feet. Again.> I won't allow your love to go unrequited. 
        Not like mine.

        KRAMER: What, again with you?

        NEWMAN: Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of 
        textures...and moments.

        KRAMER: If only I could say things like that around her.

        NEWMAN (getting an idea): Yes...


        New scene - Elaine and George at the coffee shop listening to the briefcase 
        tape.

        ELAINE: Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by 
        a metallic 'squink'...

        GEORGE: Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!

        ELAINE: ...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'

        GEORGE: It's baffling, isn't it?

        ELAINE: Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking 
        them what happened to the briefcase?

        GEORGE: They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably 
        think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. <Jerry 
        comes over to the table.>

        JERRY: That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!

        ELAINE: Ga-ga? When did that happen?

        JERRY: Yesterday. Six-ish.

        ELAINE: Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.

        JERRY: You just met the guy yesterday.

        ELAINE: Yeah, but we have a common goal.

        JERRY: A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?

        ELAINE (happily): Yeah.

        GEORGE: And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.

        ELAINE: Yeah, of course.

        JERRY: Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.

        ELAINE: Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.

        GEORGE: Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon 
        my French."

        JERRY: I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right 
        to my thighs.

        GEORGE: I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my 
        family.


        New scene - Kramer and Newman in an aisle at the bookstore where Pam works.

        NEWMAN: With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. 
        <Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the 
        aisle to talk to Pam.>

        PAM: Oh, hi! Kramer.

        NEWMAN (whispers through the bookcase): Hi. How are you?

        KRAMER: Hi. How are you?

        PAM: I'm great.

        NEWMAN: I too am well.

        KRAMER: I too am well.

        NEWMAN: Do I smell Pantene?

        KRAMER: Do I smell?

        NEWMAN: Pantene!

        KRAMER: Uh, Pantene. 

        PAM: Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with 
        my junk mail.

        KRAMER (talks rapidly in an attempt to keep up with Newman): Well, there 
        really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday 
        card, but...

        NEWMAN (frantic): ...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as 
        their precious little greeting cards...

        KRAMER: Newman! <Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.>

        PAM: What?

        KRAMER: Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance. 

        PAM: That's so true.

        KRAMER: Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...

        NEWMAN: Shell.

        KRAMER: ...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening 
        spell...just before the other shoe...fell.

        PAM: Kramer, that is so lovely.

        KRAMER: It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.

        PAM: Oh, what's his name?

        KRAMER: Newman. <On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.>


        New scene - Elaine and Kevin in Elaine's apartment.

        KEVIN: Elaine, you've changed my life.

        ELAINE: Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and 
        it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if 
        you mean it or not.

        KEVIN: I got a vasectomy this morning.


        ELAINE: Although, I have a hunch you mean it.


        New scene - Jerry talking with Pam at the bookstore.

        JERRY: I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this 
        relationship. Really happy.

        PAM: Oh. Well, that's um...<clears her throat>...nice. <Jerry 
        looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip 
        has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.>

        JERRY's brain: A velvet scrunchie!

        JERRY: Kramer!


        New scene - Jerry approaching his apartment door. He meets Newman coming 
        out of Kramer's place.

            
        JERRY: Hello, Newman.

        NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?

        JERRY: Pam? What do you care? <Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying 
        a Brentano's bookstore bag.>

        NEWMAN: Well, ta-ta! <Scampers away.>

        JERRY: Wait a minute! <A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing 
        Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches 
        up with him in the hallway on another floor.>

        JERRY: Alright, Newman! This is it! <Shoves him against the wall.>

        NEWMAN (sweating): Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your 
        cool at a time like this. 

        JERRY: Why not?

        NEWMAN: Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. <Newman 
        giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked 
        off.>

        JERRY (rolls his eyes): C'mon. <They exit.>


        New scene - Jerry and Newman in Newman's apartment.

        JERRY: I can't believe I'm losing Pam!

        NEWMAN: I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.

        JERRY: I thought we were talking about me.

        NEWMAN: Right.

        JERRY: Anyway, I don't need your help. <Turns to leave.>

        NEWMAN: Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that 
        beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up 
        your inane "observations"?

        JERRY: Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling 
        the strings for Kramer?

        NEWMAN: Well, there is a little something you can do for me...

        JERRY: C'mon, out with it.

        NEWMAN: It's about...Elaine.

        JERRY: Elaine? What does she have to - <notices Newman looking up at 
        him longlingly.> Oh no...

        NEWMAN: You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can 
        use!

        JERRY (shrugs): Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. <Newman 
        considers the implications of this.>


        Cut back to Elaine and Kevin at Elaine's apartment.

        KEVIN: I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.

        ELAINE: I know, I don't want...<clears her throat>...kids.

        KEVIN: What was that?

        ELAINE: Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a 
        hundred percent.

        KEVIN: This is! Oh boy, I always do this.

        ELAINE: What?

        KEVIN: Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with 
        it. 

        ELAINE: Really?

        KEVIN: Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those 
        jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.

        ELAINE: You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same 
        way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all 
        these strands hanging in my face all the time...

        KEVIN: Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!

        ELAINE: Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short. 

        KEVIN: Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.

        ELAINE: Yeah!

        KEVIN: Yeah!


        New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's kitchen. George has brought over 
        a model of the conference room at the Foundation.

        GEORGE: This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.

        JERRY: When did you build this thing?

        GEORGE: Yesterday, took the day off. <Picks up a red Power Ranger action 
        figure from the model and pretends it's him.> Now, from the time I 
        left the room...

        JERRY (points at the Power Ranger): Wait, that's you?

        GEORGE: Yeah.

        JERRY (picks up a yellow M&M toy from the model): I really think the 
        M&M should be you.

        GEORGE (grabs the M&M away from Jerry): Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever 
        caused the damage...<drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model>...was 
        jarring enough to completely stop the tape.

        JERRY: And?

        GEORGE: Okay. That's what we know.

        JERRY: But we already knew that. 

        GEORGE: Well, yeah.

        JERRY: Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.

        GEORGE: I don't know if you're ready for it.

        JERRY: Please.

        GEORGE: I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic 
        process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have 
        never - 

        JERRY: Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. <The 
        door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.> Yeah?

        VOICE ON SPEAKER: It's Pam.

        JERRY: C'mon up. <To George> Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'

        GEORGE: I'm not through here, Jerry. <Picks up the model of the conference 
        room.> I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. 
        The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. <Pam enters, George leaves.>

        PAM: What was that?

        JERRY: We were just playin.'

        PAM: Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today...

        JERRY: Uh huh...

        PAM: Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. 
        <Kramer slides in the door on his knees.>

        KRAMER: I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!

        JERRY (to Pam): This is the man you have a crush on?

        PAM: Well, I have feelings for both of you.

        KRAMER: How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.

        JERRY: Why can't I be a soul mate?

        KRAMER: Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father 
        of her children?

        PAM: Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have 
        children.

        <Jerry and Kramer look at each other, puzzled.>



        New scene - George back at the conference room at the Foundation.

        GEORGE: There are some people in this room who would have been very happy 
        to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think 
        they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let 
        me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this 
        brain! And this tape recorder.

        WYCK: George...

        GEORGE: You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. <Plays back 
        the tape.> That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low 
        rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear 
        God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.

        WYCK: George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and 
        dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, 
        contained a running tape recorder?

        GEORGE: Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.


        New scene - Jerry and Newman in the office of Bernard Wendroff, M.D. - 
        urologist. Elaine and Kevin enter. Elaine has cut her hair short.

        ELAINE: What are you guys doing here?

        JERRY: We're getting vasectomies.

        ELAINE: Why?

        NEWMAN (to Elaine): I'm doing it for you.

        ELAINE: What?

        JERRY (to Elaine): What'd you do to your hair?

        ELAINE: I cut it.

        JERRY: It's a little short.

        KEVIN: Y'think?

        JERRY (to Kevin): What are you doing here?

        ELAINE: Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.

        JERRY and NEWMAN: Reversed?! <Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors 
        office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry 
        and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.>


        Commercial break.

        New scene - George reading the poem for Susan at the Foundation.

        GEORGE: ...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.

        WYCK: Is that a Keats poem?

        GEORGE: No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. <Smiles, pats his briefcase 
        and exits.>

        WYCK: Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?

        MR. CROSS: Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her.

        MS. BAINES: Of course he killed her.

        WYCK: So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.

        First scene.
        Jerry and a woman are eating at a restaurant.

        Woman: Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found 
        that so
        limiting.

        Jerry: My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other 
        day. 
        He was with Brant-Leland for a while.

        Woman: Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best 
        move
        I ever made.

        Jerry: Mentor? You mean your boss.

        Woman: Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken 
        me
        under her wing.

        Jerry: Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.

        Woman: And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, 
        who
        guides you in your career path.

        Jerry: Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.


        New scene.
        George and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.

        George: I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?

        Jerry: Yes. And the mentor advises the protg.

        George: Is there any money involved?

        Jerry: No.

        George: So what's in it for the mentor?

        Jerry: Respect, admiration, prestige.

        George: Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?

        Jerry: I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.

        George: Laundry? Dry cleaning?

        Jerry: It's not a valet, it's a protg.

        George: Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I 
        do this
        here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.

        Jerry (checking out George's textbook): Risk management?

        George: Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give 
        a
        lecture in their area of business expertise.

        Jerry: Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?

        George: I guess it's on my resume.

        The phone rings, Jerry answers.

        Jerry: Hello?

        Voice: Please hold for Elaine Benes.

        George: You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books 
        on
        tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* 
        voice. 
        I hate my voice.

        Jerry: So get this book on tape.

        George: You can't, it's a textbook.

        Elaine: Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?

        Jerry: Am I going? It was three nights ago.

        Elaine: What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I 
        was so
        excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.

        Jerry: Oh, it was a lovely affair.

        Elaine: Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens 
        all
        the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?

        Jeanine: Eddie Sherman.

        Elaine: Alright, send him up here.

        Jerry: You gonna do a little yelling?

        Elaine: I'm gonna do a little firing.

        Jerry: That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?

        Elaine: Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.

        Jerry gets a dial tone and hangs up; he looks over at George who has nodded 
        off
        with the book in his lap. Jerry picks up a peanut and tosses it at George,
        hitting him in the glasses and waking him up.

        Jerry: Hey, Copernicus?


        New scene.
        Elaine's office.

        Jeanine: Eddie Sherman is here.

        Elaine: Oh, great. Send him in.

        Eddie Sherman walks in dressed in full military fatigues. He speaks in 
        a raspy
        voice.

        Eddie: You wanted to see me?

        Elaine: Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have 
        to...
        promote you.


        New scene.
        Elaine and Jerry are at the coffee shop.

        Jerry: So, what did you say?

        Elaine: Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell 
        him
        something important. So I promoted him.

        Jerry: What? What did you--

        Elaine: Copywriter.


        Jerry: He's writing copy?

        Elaine: Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally 
        churn
        out.

        Kramer walks in carrying a stack of flyers, he hands a few to Jerry and 
        Elaine.

        Kramer: Yowza yowza. Check it out.

        Jerry (reading): Jewish singles night?

        Kramer: I expect you both to be there.

        Elaine: I'm not Jewish.

        Kramer: Well neither am I.

        Jerry: Well why are you going?

        Kramer: I'm not, I'm running it.

        Jerry: What are you talking about?

        Kramer: Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.

        Jerry: Lomez is Jewish?

        Kramer: Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.

        Elaine (reading): At the Knights of Columbus?

        Kramer: Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So 
        Jerry,
        you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.

        Jerry: Kramer, you know, I--

        Kramer: No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.

        Elaine (reading): A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.

        Kramer: Do you like tsimmis?


        New scene.
        Jerry and Abby are being seated in a restaurant.

        Abby: My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.

        Jerry: I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.

        Abby: Oh! Look who's here, Cynthia!

        Cynthia: Hello, Abby.

        Abby: Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor.

        Jerry: Hello.

        Cynthia: Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you.

        Abby: Well come join us, we could pull up a chair.

        Cynthia: Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, 
        you
        night know him, he's a comic too.

        Jerry: No kidding?

        Cynthia: Kenny Banya.

        Jerry: Banya?

        Banya enters.

        Banya: Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The 
        duck
        here's the best. The best, Jerry.


        New scene.
        George is on the subway, seated beside a blind man wearing headphones.

        George: Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a 
        textbook
        on tape. May I ask where you got that?

        Man: Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.

        George: I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.

        Man: Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.


        New scene.
        George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.

        Jerry: Reading for the Blind?

        George: I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging
        to the sweet sounds of risk management.

        Jerry: So, I finally met the mentor.

        George: What's she like? Impressive?

        Jerry: Oh yeah, she's dating Banya.

        George: Banya?

        Jerry: Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.

        George: What did you have?

        Jerry: Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends 
        time
        with Banya?

        George: Marsala?

        Jerry: Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Banya should 
        be
        setting pins in a bowling alley.

        George (leaving): Alright, I got a test to fail.

        Jerry: Hey, good luck with that.

        George: Thank you.

        George opens the door to see Kramer and Frank leaving Kramer's apartment.

        George: Dad.

        Frank: What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?

        George: What are you doing here?

        Kramer: Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You 
        know I
        got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.

        Jerry: Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred 
        and
        eighty-three people?

        Kramer: Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know
        anybody who can help me cook?

        Frank: Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!

        Frank storms out of the apartment.

        Kramer: What's the matter with him?

        George: My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened,
        ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.

        Kramer: Shell-shocked?

        George: Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.

        Elaine is wrapping up a meeting at Peterman's.

        Elaine: That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.

        Eddie: Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas.

        Elaine: Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.

        Eddie: I'm ready.

        Elaine: Oh, okay.

        Eddie (reading): It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your
        knife; the only friend who hasn't betrayed you, the only friend who won't 
        be
        dead by sun up. Sleep tight, mates, in your quilted Chambray nightshirts.


        New scene.
        Elaine and Jerry are at the coffee shop.

        Elaine: What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.

        Jerry: Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.

        Elaine: You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, 
        I
        should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and 
        he can
        sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.

        New scene.
        George is taking an eye exam.


        George: Nothing at all.

        Doctor: Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign 
        this
        insurance form, here's a pen.

        George reaches for the pen and grabs the Doctor's face.

        George: You're a very handsome man, by the way.

        Jerry walks into his apartment; there are pots and pans bubbling on the 
        stove.

        Jerry: What the hell is going on here?

        Kramer comes running in holding a scalding pot full of dumplings, he drops 
        the
        pot into the sink and cools his burnt fingers.

        Jerry: What are you doing?

        Kramer: I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I 
        got
        kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.

        Jerry: No, I don't want to.

        Kramer: Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.

        Jerry gabs a fork and tastes a piece.

        Kramer: Hah?

        Jerry: Oh, this is awful.

        Kramer: Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.

        Kramer bites into one and spits it out.

        Jerry: Did you follow the recipe?

        Kramer: The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a 
        hundred
        and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.

        Jerry: It tastes like dirt.

        Kramer: Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I 
        got no
        skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got 
        no
        sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.

        Jerry: Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.

        Kramer: No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.

        Abby walks in.

        Abby: I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.

        Kramer: My stuffed cabbage!

        Kramer runs out.

        Abby: So, great dinner last night.

        Jerry: Yeah, it was alright.

        Abby: I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Banya Saturday and then 
        catch his
        act.

        Jerry: No. No, no way, no Banya.

        Abby: What?

        Jerry: Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. 
        
        He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.

        Abby: Cynthia would not date a hack.

        Jerry: Would. Does. Is.

        Elaine is chairing a meeting at Peterman's.

        Elaine: Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman 
        is no
        longer writing for this catalog.

        There are general remarks of relief from the meeting attendees.

        Elaine: He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.

        Employee: You promoted him?

        Elaine: Well, no, I would hardly--

        Employee: I bust my hump ever day.

        Elaine: Relax--

        Employee: As far as I'm concerned, you and your deranged protg can run 
        the
        catalog by yourselves! I quit!

        What follows is a chorus of "me too"s and "I'm with him"s 
        as everybody walks
        out.

        Elaine: Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!


        New scene.
        George is in his office at Yankee stadium, he pushes 'play' on a cassette
        recorder. The voice on the tape sounds exactly like George.

        Voice: Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk. 
        
        How do you spot risk? How do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky?

        George: This guy sounds just like me.

        Voice: To understand risk, we must first define risk.

        George: This is horrible.

        Voice: Risk is defined as--

        George (banging the recorder): Stop it! Stop it!


        New scene.
        Kramer is at Frank's.


        Kramer: C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.

        Frank: In my mind, there's a war still going on.

        Kramer: Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?

        Frank pours a shot of whiskey and drinks it.

        Frank: Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging
        hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were 
        getting
        thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds 
        of
        prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three 
        weeks
        past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right
        spices, cooked it long enough...

        Kramer: What happened?

        Frank: I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around
        me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my 
        own men
        to the latrines that night. They were just boys.

        Kramer: Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time 
        for
        everyone.

        Frank: Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. 
        Well
        he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. 
        Had to
        sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!

        Kramer: Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. 
        This is
        your chance to make it all right again.

        Frank: No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! 
        Get
        out. Go.


        New scene.
        Jerry and Abby are in Jerry's apartment.

        Jerry: So you saw Banya's act?

        Abby: He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't 
        take it
        anymore.

        Jerry: I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.

        Abby: Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?

        Jerry: He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.


        Abby: Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and 
        I think
        it's over.

        Jerry: No more mentor?

        Abby: Looks that way.

        Jerry: Well at least you and I are okay again.

        Abby: Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each 
        other
        for a while.

        Jerry: Why?

        Abby: Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not 
        to
        have an advisor.

        Jerry: I can tell you what to do.

        Abby: No, it's more than that.

        Jerry: I can tell you what to think.

        Abby: I need someone I can trust.

        Jerry: Oh.

        George busts in.

        George: I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.

        Jerry: Kind of in the middle of something here, George.

        George shuts up and relaxes on the couch.

        Jerry: George?

        Abby: I gotta run anyway.

        Jerry: I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.

        Abby: I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll 
        see ya.

        Jerry: Yeah, see ya.

        Abby leaves and George gets up and runs out the door after her.

        Jerry: What's your problem.

        George runs back.

        George: No problem.

        George runs away again.

        Eddie: Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes.

        Elaine: Oh.

        Eddie (reading): It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking 
        in a
        skull.

        Elaine: You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.

        Eddie: Well, I'm not married to it.

        Elaine. Oh. Well, um, in that case why don't we take the phrase, "kicking 
        in a
        skull" and we tweak it, you know, just a hair, to something like, 
        what, like
        "strolling through a dewy meadow"?

        Eddie: Dewy meadow.

        Estelle: That's the way I always make it.

        Frank: Well it sucks.

        Estelle: What did you say?

        Frank: Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your
        eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!

        Estelle: Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around 
        here!

        Frank: Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!

        George and Abby are at George's office.

        Abby: And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take 
        on a
        protg?

        George: I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, 
        naive, I
        didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.

        Abby: I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me.

        George: I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just 
        see if
        you can explain it to me.

        Jerry: Oh, that's too bad.

        Banya: Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute 
        worst. 
        The worst, Jerry.

        Jerry: Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got 
        that
        Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to 
        Ovaltine--

        Banya (reading): Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar

        Elaine is reviewing copy with Eddie.

        Abby: Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much.

        Abby places her risk management folder on the table.

        Jerry: About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?

        Abby: You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the
        mentor/mentor relationship.

        Jerry: As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.


        Jerry places his Banya folder on the table.

        Abby: Who?

        Jerry: A Mister Kenneth Banya.

        Abby: Banya?

        Jerry: I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.

        Abby: Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protg is 
        a hack.

        Abby picks up a folder and puts it in her bag.

        between
        us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.

        Eddie: Cool.

        Elaine: Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and 
        all the
        psychotic imagery? Huh?

        Eddie: I don't want to talk about it.

        Elaine: Come on, don't be a baby.

        Eddie: I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she 
        really
        liked me, and then things kind of cooled off.

        Elaine: That's it?

        Eddie: Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish.

        Elaine: I can't get off the kishkas.

        Banya: Hey Jerry!

        Jerry: Banya?

        Banya: I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you 
        wrote
        for me? It's killer!

        Jerry: Risk management?

        Banya: Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and 
        even
        Cynthia took me back.

        Cut to a woman talking with Eddie Sherman.

        Woman: So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development
        in two days?

        Eddie: That's right.

        Woman: How much are they paying you? I'll double it.

        Cut to Kramer and Frank behind a table loaded with 'Jewish delicacies'.

        Kramer: Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.

        Frank: Where's the powdered sugar?

        Kramer: You know Frank, you could take a break.

        Frank: No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.

        Cut to Eddie breaking the news to Elaine.

        Elaine: You're quitting?

        Eddie: I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.

        Elaine: Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!

        Elaine grabs Eddie by the lapels and shakes him, Eddie chokes on a piece 
        of
        bread. Frank sees this and flashes back to Korea. He runs around the room
        knocking plates to the floor and when Kramer tries to stop him, he heads 
        to the
        loaded down table and starts to tip it over. The scene ends in mid-tip.

        George: Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?

        George flips through a few pages.

        George: They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.

        Wilhelm (proudly, to the man seated beside him): He's my protg.

        [Street]

        Jerry and Elaine come out of a drugstore. Elaine has a couple of carrier 
        bags
        she's fussing with the contents of.

        JERRY: Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs?
        Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.

        ELAINE: Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.

        JERRY: Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get
        sick?

        Jerry and Elaine begin to walk along the street.

        ELAINE: What is this, a 'bit'?

        JERRY: No.

        ELAINE: 'Cos I'm not in the mood.

        JERRY: We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? 
        If
        you feel good, you're supposed to take one!

        ELAINE: Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.

        JERRY: They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.

        ELAINE: (tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?

        JERRY: (hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?

        ELAINE: It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, 
        and
        hit the word 'good' harder.

        JERRY: (thinking) Great. Thanks.


        [Some Fancy Place]

        The room is stylishly furnished. A number of people sit around, chatting 
        and
        drinking. Elaine and her new boyfriend, Brett, walk across the room, carrying
        drinks.

        ELAINE: So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?

        BRETT: We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.

        Elaine and Brett sit on a couch

        ELAINE: (as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.

        BRETT: You know Farbman?

        ELAINE: Mm, love Farbman.   

        BRETT: Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.

        ELAINE: Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.

        Music begins to play. It's The Eagles' Desperado. Brett hears the music 
        and
        is enraptured. He stares off into the distance, oblivious to everything 
        but
        the song.

        ELAINE: Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?

        Brett hasn't heard a word of what Elaine said, continuing to stare off 
        into
        the distance.

        ELAINE: Brett? Don't you think that would be great?

        Brett still doesn't react.

        ELAINE: Brett?

        BRETT: (still staring off) After the song, babe.

        ELAINE: Huh?

        BRETT: The song.

        Elaine stares at Brett and puts a hand to her chest, moved by his
        sensitivity.


        [Street]

        Jerry and Elaine come round the corner, past the Chinese restaurant and 
        walk
        along the street.

        JERRY: So when do I meet this jerk?

        ELAINE: He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.

        JERRY: Who?

        ELAINE: (dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous,
        and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.

        JERRY: What song?

        ELAINE: Desperado.

        JERRY: Desperado?

        ELAINE: Uh huh.

        JERRY: And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.

        Ahead of the strolling twosome, a guy stands on the sidewalk, twirling 
        a
        brightly-coloured umbrella over his shoulder.

        JERRY: (pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.

        ELAINE: Uh huh.

        JERRY: I invented that.

        ELAINE: That, had to be invented?

        JERRY: When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea 
        to
        twirl it, to attract customers.

        Elaine folds her arms, unconvinced.

        ELAINE: (skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?

        Elaine marches toward the umbrella guy.

        JERRY: Elaine.

        ELAINE: Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that 
        he
        invented that little twirl you're doing.

        JERRY: Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a 
        history
        lesson.

        CLICKY: Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.


        ELAINE: (looking at Jerry) Ohh.

        JERRY: I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.

        CLICKY: Yeah, that's where he come up with it.

        JERRY: In his dreams.

        ELAINE: Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?

        Elaine walks off, crossing the street. Jerry follows.

        JERRY: (to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient 
        the
        customers.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry is demonstrating twirling an umbrella to George, who sits in a chair
        with a magazine.

        JERRY: It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.

        GEORGE: (pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway?
        Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.

        JERRY: (as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.

        Jerry tosses his umbrella onto the couch, and walks toward the kitchen. 
        The
        door opens and Kramer enters, carrying a large envelope.

        KRAMER: Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you.
        Ker-ching.

        JERRY: (taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster
        than I can sign 'em.

        GEORGE: What checks?

        KRAMER: Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.

        JERRY: I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening
        credits of some Japanese comedy show.

        KRAMER: Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.

        JERRY: (opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run 
        it
        all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.

        GEORGE: Look at all of those! You're rich!

        JERRY: Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain 
        in
        my hand to sign 'em.

        Kramer sits on the couch and flinches as he sits on the umbrella. He reaches
        under himself and extracts it, then jumps again as he accidentally opens 
        it.
        He gets back up, and heads to the kitchen.

        KRAMER: Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?

        JERRY: Why?

        KRAMER: (getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's
        new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. 
        It's
        a Farbman.

        George wanders over.

        GEORGE: He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?

        JERRY: Ah, who are any of her losers?

        GEORGE: (dryly) You're on that list.

        George goes and gets his coat.

        GEORGE: Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet
        cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.

        KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

        EGO: Yeah, you heard of 'em?

        KRAMER: They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a 
        means
        for them to get into your apartment.

        GEORGE: So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless
        blather.

        JERRY: I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.


        [Street]

        Kramer and Jerry stroll along. Jerry is massaging his left hand, as if 
        it's
        giving him discomfort.

        JERRY: Signed over a hundred checks this morning.

        KRAMER: Hello, twelve dollars.

        Jerry and Kramer draw level with three Japanese tourists. One of them 
        steps
        forward, holding out a camera.

        MR OH: Excuse me. Would you take picture please?

        KRAMER: (takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure.

        Jerry has spotted something further along the street. It's another umbrella
        salesman, twirling his wares.

        JERRY: I'm gonna ask this guy something.

        Jerry walks along to the guy. Kramer fusses about, taking a picture of 
        the
        three Japanese guys, at one point he steps back to frame them all, and
        stumbles off the curb.

        JERRY: (to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented
        that, don't you?

        Back down the street, Kramer has finished photographing. He looks over 
        toward
        Jerry, and thinks for a second.

        KRAMER: (to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.

        MR YAMAGUCHI: Hai.

        MR OH: Yes.

        KRAMER: (points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?

        Jerry has taken one of the umbrellas, and is demonstrating the twirl to 
        the
        guy. He's speaking animatedly, with lots of hand gestures and arm waving.

        KRAMER: That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the 
        Super
        Terrific Happy Hour.

        MR OH: Ahh, Super Terrific Happy...

        The three guys all speak to each other in excited Japanese.

        KRAMER: Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.

        Kramer and the three guys look along to where Jerry is still talking
        vigorously to the umbrella guy.

        MR OH: What is he doing?

        KRAMER: Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.

        MR OH: He's funny.

        KRAMER: Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his
        antics.

        Jerry is tossing the umbrella from hand to hand, with the unimpressed 
        guy
        watching him. Kramer laughs, and the Japanese all join in.

        KRAMER: Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here 
        in
        America.

        Kramer and the Japanese all laugh uproariously, watching Jerry.


        [George's Apartment]

        Three guys in bright yellow overalls stand in George's living room. Two 
        of
        them have a large carpet cleaner by the door, ready to leave, The third, 
        the
        leader, has a notebook.

        CREW LEADER: (calling to George) We're pretty much finished.

        George enters from another room.

        CREW LEADER: There's just one more thing.

        GEORGE: (smiling expectantly) Here it comes.

        The leader opens his book and holds up a check.

        CREW LEADER: (clears throat) You forgot to sign your check.

        The leader hands George a pen, and waits as George appends his signature.


        GEORGE: (signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything
        else?

        CREW LEADER: (flat) No.

        The carpet cleaners begin to leave. George follows the leader toward the
        door, looking disappointed.

        GEORGE: (let down) So, that's it?

        CREW LEADER: Unless you need a receipt.

        GEORGE: (melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing.
        I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.

        CREW LEADER: (flat) Good luck with that.

        The leader closes the door on a perplexed George.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry sits at his table. He's signing checks, and holding his pen awkwardly
        in his hand which is twisted uncomfortably. Elaine enters and notices 
        his
        hand.

        JERRY: Hey.

        ELAINE: What's with the claw?

        JERRY: Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.

        Elaine wanders toward the kitchen. The door opens and Brett enters.

        BRETT: (to Elaine) There's no sign of Kramer.

        ELAINE: Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.

        JERRY: Hi.

        Jerry holds up his twisted hand in greeting. Brett copies the position 
        of the
        fingers in his wave back.

        BRETT: That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.

        JERRY: Ah, I'm one kind.

        Elaine gets a bottle of water form the fridge.

        ELAINE: Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?

        JERRY: The Fleckman.

        BRETT: Farbman.

        JERRY: Right.

        ELAINE: You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.

        JERRY: (not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.

        BRETT: I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.

        JERRY: No. I'm fine, thank you.

        BRETT: Don't worry. It's no charge to you.

        Brett walks over past Jerry and points to Jerry's desk.

        BRETT: Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your
        skits.

        JERRY: (quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.

        BRETT: (walking back to Elaine) Well, of course you don't. You don't have 
        a
        proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue.

        ELAINE: Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.

        BRETT: (quiet) Oops.

        Brett looks round at Jerry, seeming embarrassed.

        BRETT: Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we 
        should
        get going.

        Brett opens the door.

        ELAINE: Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?

        JERRY: Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?

        BRETT: (scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. 
        You
        look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.

        JERRY: You look like you could use a...

        ELAINE: (warning) Jerry.


        [Saks]

        Kramer and the Japanese tourists are looking at stuff. Kramer picks up 
        a
        Stetson and reads the price tag.

        KRAMER: (reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these 
        run
        you in Tokyo?

        Kramer holds the hat over, so Mr Oh can get a look.

        MR OH: (thinks for a second) Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen.

        KRAMER: (shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.

        Kramer places the hat on an unsure Mr Oh's head.

        KRAMER: Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.

        Kramer hands Stetsons to each of the other Japanese.


        [Brett's Car]

        Brett and Elaine sit in his parked two seat Ferrari.

        BRETT: I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave 
        Kramer
        that chest of drawers, isn't he?

        ELAINE: Why? Why d'you think he's upset?

        BRETT: How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And
        outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.

        ELAINE: (romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, 
        are we?

        BRETT: (smiling) I hope not.

        Brett leans across to kiss Elaine. Just as they begin to kiss, the Eagles'
        Desperado comes on the radio. Brett immediately breaks off the kiss, and
        stares off into the distance again.

        ELAINE: (surprised) Brett? Everything alright?

        Brett makes no response.

        ELAINE: (worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?

        BRETT: Elaine, the song.

        ELAINE: (relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought
        it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging 
        on
        the fender...

        BRETT: Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?

        ELAINE: (apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.

        Elaine stares queryingly at the rapt Brett.


        [Monk's]

        Jerry and George sit in a booth, sipping coffee.

        JERRY: No spiel?

        GEORGE: (annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. 
        Call
        themselves a cult!

        JERRY: So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt 
        to
        abduct you?

        GEORGE: They could've at least tried!

        JERRY: You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?

        GEORGE: Please.

        JERRY: Too dumb?

        George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters, wearing a snazzy new suit. He
        strolls over to the booth.

        JERRY: (impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.

        KRAMER: Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits 
        beside

        Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at 
        the
        Rainbow Room.

        JERRY: Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.

        KRAMER: Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that 
        sushi
        you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that 
        money
        goes, hmm?

        Jerry looks puzzled.

        KRAMER: That's right.

        GEORGE: How'd you hook up with these guys?

        KRAMER: Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. 
        See
        now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.

        JERRY: What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?

        KRAMER: (to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.

        GEORGE: (excited) Yeah, the pilot!

        KRAMER: That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.

        GEORGE: (enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese 
        TV.
        They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in 
        New
        York!

        JERRY: Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.

        GEORGE: (animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn 
        on a
        TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about
        their dates!

        Jerry looks doubtful.

        KRAMER: George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, 
        but in
        Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.

        Jerry looks at George, wondering.


        [Japanese TV Office]

        Jerry and George sit on a couch. Two Japanese TV executives, one male, 
        one
        female, sit on chairs. They are all watching the pilot show Jerry made 
        at the
        end of Season 4. The Japanese are not looking impressed. George is smiling
        and pointing, enthusiastically. On a coffee table sits a large bowl
        containing a plastic bag of oranges.

        TV JERRY: You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could 
        go
        out with my butler?!

        TV ELAINE: Well, why do I need your permission?

        TV JERRY: Because he's my butler.

        The first executive stops the tape.

        GEORGE: (eager) So? What d'you think?

        EXECUTIVE 1: We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?

        GEORGE: Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a 
        car
        accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge
        decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.

        EXECUTIVE 1: Is this customary in your legal system?

        JERRY: No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.

        EXECUTIVE 1: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Are you following any of this?

        EXECUTIVE 2: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: I'm still trying to figure out 
        why
        they gave us a bag of oranges.

        EXECUTIVE 1: (to Jerry and George) I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is 
        very
        funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan.

        GEORGE: Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America 
        too
        long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to 
        have
        no oranges.

        Jerry nods, sagely, and picks up a cup of coffee. His fingers are still
        twisted from the check signing.

        EXECUTIVE 1: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Again with the oranges

        There's a crash as Jerry's grip on the cup fails and he drops it.

        JERRY: (flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.

        GEORGE: (positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy
        Hour. (laughs)

        EXECUTIVE 1: You must go now.

        Jerry pats George on the knee. George squeezes Jerry's shoulder and they
        ruefully begin to depart.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry sits at his table, signing yet more checks, the pen gripped in his
        clawed fingers. Elaine stands in her jacket, her bag on the table.

        ELAINE: Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during
        Desperado.

        JERRY: (throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado
        station?

        ELAINE: He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, 
        I'm
        sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.

        JERRY: You know, what you need is a song you can share.

        ELAINE: Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.

        JERRY: Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?

        Elaine tips back her head and thinks for a second, before something occurs.

        ELAINE: (points) I like Witchy Woman.

        JERRY: Witchy Woman?

        ELAINE: You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.

        JERRY: (getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.

        The door opens and Kramer enters, wearing his suit and carrying another 
        fat
        envelope.

        KRAMER: (to Jerry) Hey, man.

        ELAINE: Hey.

        Kramer puts the envelope down on the table next to Jerry. Elaine walks 
        to the
        kitchen.

        JERRY: Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?

        KRAMER: Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight
        monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.

        JERRY: Ah.

        KRAMER: Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?

        JERRY: What for?

        Kramer wanders into Jerry's bedroom.

        KRAMER (O.C.): Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with 
        me.

        JERRY: I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?

        Kramer reenters, carrying three pillows.

        KRAMER: Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like 
        you
        do.

        JERRY: Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?

        KRAMER: Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even 
        with
        fifty thousand yen.

        Elaine is in the kitchen, eating cereal from the box.

        ELAINE: Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?

        KRAMER: Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest 
        of
        drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.


        ELAINE: In them?!

        JERRY: You have them sleeping in drawers?!

        KRAMER: Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep 
        in
        tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.

        JERRY: This has 'international incident' written all over it.

        KRAMER: (smiling) Oh yeah, yeah.


        [Kramer's Apartment]

        Up against one wall of the apartment stands a very large chest of three
        drawers. It's about six feet long and each drawers is maybe a foot and 
        a half
        deep. Kramer walks over to it and looks into the open top drawer.

        KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.

        One of the Japanese tourists sits up in the drawer.

        MR TANAKA: Goodnight.

        Mr Tanaka lies down again, and Kramer slides the drawer shut. He then 
        speaks
        to the occupant of the next drawer.

        KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr Oh.

        MR OH: (sits up) Goodnight.

        Mr Oh lies back down and Kramer slides the drawers shut, and speaks to 
        the
        final drawer's occupant.

        KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.

        MR YAMAGUCHI: (sits up) Oh, yes. Goodnight.

        Mr Yamaguchi lies down. Kramer shuts the final drawer, switches off the 
        lamp
        and, yawning, walks off toward his own bed


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Kramer is in the kitchen. He has three bowls out on the counter, and a 
        box of
        Rice Crispies. Jerry walks over, pushing a bunch of checks into an envelope.

        JERRY: What is this?

        KRAMER: Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.

        JERRY: Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well,
        I'm off to the bank.

        KRAMER: (opening the fridge) Sayonara.

        JERRY: (leaving) Konichi-wa.

        Kramer fetches out milk and continues making breakfast.


        [Brett's Car]

        Elaine and Brett sit in the parked Ferrari. Witchy Woman is playing on 
        the
        stereo. Elaine is listening, with her eyes closed and her head nodding. 
        Brett
        looks puzzled.

        BRETT: Elaine, I...

        ELAINE: Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?

        Elaine continues to listen. Brett leans forward and switches off the music.

        ELAINE: What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.

        BRETT: Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.

        ELAINE: Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.

        BRETT: (flat) No. It's mine.

        There is a flash of lightning and thunder rolls. Elaine peers out at the
        weather.


        [Kramer's Apartment]

        The top and bottom drawers are open in the chest. Mr Yamaguchi sits up 
        in the
        bottom drawer, and Mr Tanaka sits on top of the chest, with his feet in 
        his
        drawer. Kramer comes over and hands bowls of Rice Crispies to the pair 
        of
        them.

        KRAMER: Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.

        Kramer leans over and raps on the face of the middle drawer.

        KRAMER: (loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.

        MR OH (O.C.): Ach, come back in half hour.

        Kramer looks impatient. He puts the bowl of Rice Crispies on top of the 
        chest
        and walks off mumbling irritably.


        [Street]

        It is pouring with rain. Jerry walks along the street, wearing just a 
        light
        jacket over his clothes. He still has the envelope in his hands. Jerry 
        spots
        the umbrella vendor, twirling his wares.

        JERRY: (calls) Hey, I'll take one.

        CLICKY: Well, look who's back!

        Clicky turns to another umbrella seller,who is facing the other way.

        CLICKY: Teddy! (indicates Jerry) This's the guy says he invented the twirl.

        TEDDY: (unfriendly recognition) Jerry Seinfeld!

        JERRY: Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) 
        What've
        you got in a push-button mini.

        TEDDY: (bitter) Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years 
        ago.

        JERRY: Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we 
        had
        some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?

        TEDDY: (angry) Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze 
        of
        eighty-four? I almost lost my house.

        A guy comes along the street, wearing one of Elaine's urban sombreros. 
        Clicky
        tries to catch his attention.

        CLICKY: Umbrella, buddy?

        The sombrero wearer waves away the attention and crosses the street.

        CLICKY: Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with.

        TEDDY: (to Clicky) Easy, there. (to Jerry) I hear you're taking credit 
        for
        the twirl.

        JERRY: Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?

        TEDDY: (intense) I care. Clicky cares.

        JERRY: So, could I...

        Another peal of thunder rolls as interruption.

        JERRY: Could I just buy an umbrella?

        TEDDY: (sour) Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars.

        JERRY: (shock) What?!

        TEDDY: (caustically) Special price, for a real foul-weather friend.

        The rain continues to pour down unabated.


        [George's Office, Yankee Stadium]

        George is removing a tape from a VCR. Kramer enters, followed by the three
        Japanese tourists. Outside the window, the rain can be seen bucketing 
        down.

        KRAMER: Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to 
        run
        the bases.

        GEORGE: (indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the 
        tarp
        on the field.

        KRAMER: (quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys?
        Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.

        George thinks for a minute, then looks down at the tape in his hands.


        GEORGE: Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.

        KRAMER: (snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how 
        would
        you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?

        The Japanese nod to each other.

        MR OH: But, we are also very hungry.

        KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch 
        the
        tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.

        Kramer and George wave the Japanese toward seats. Kramer leaves the office
        and looks down the corridor. He raises his arm to attract attention.

        KRAMER: (shouts) Hey, peanuts!

        As the Japanese sit, Mr Wilhelm comes to the door.

        WILHELM: George. (waves George over) George.

        George goes out into the hall with Wilhelm.

        WILHELM: (puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?

        GEORGE: Are they here?

        WILHELM: They're in my office, right now.

        GEORGE: (suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?

        WILHELM: About what?

        GEORGE: (to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult 
        is
        this?!


        [Street]

        Jerry walks along. He is still carrying the envelope of checks, and by 
        now
        he's drenched. A familiar red Ferrari pulls to a stop level with Jerry, 
        and
        the window winds down.

        BRETT: (calls over) Hey Jerry!

        Jerry peers at the car and walks out into the road as he recognises Brett.

        JERRY: Oh, hi Brett.

        BRETT: Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?

        JERRY: Ah, I didn't have enough money.

        BRETT: I'm sure things'll pick up for you.

        JERRY: No, it's not that, it's the...

        Jerry looks down at the envelope of checks in his hands. The rain has 
        soaked
        them so thoroughly that the ink of his signatures has run and become
        illegible.

        JERRY: Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!

        Brett peers over at the mass of sodden paper in Jerry's grip.

        BRETT: Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the (reads) twelve cents?

        JERRY: No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing 
        and
        writing.

        BRETT: Nothing's working for you, is is?

        JERRY: (bitter) Not at the moment, Brett.

        BRETT: I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.

        Beside Brett sits a bald-headed, bearded, guy in shades.

        JERRY: (sarcastic) Thanks for stopping!

        Jerry walks away


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry is drying the checks. Dozens hang from lines around the apartment, 
        and
        more sit on the table, where Jerry dabs them with a towel.

        ELAINE: Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.

        JERRY: Boogeyman.

        ELAINE: Boogey?

        JERRY: I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?

        ELAINE: No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. 
        Hey,
        what d'you think of Oye Como Va?

        JERRY: (negative) Eehh.

        ELAINE: (desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, 
        Jer!

        Elaine puts he hand to her head, walks round the room and flops onto the
        couch. The door opens and George enters. He's in buoyant mood.

        JERRY: Hey.

        GEORGE: (excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese
        friends. They loved it!

        JERRY: Really? They bought the butler character?

        GEORGE: (excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great
        show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.

        JERRY: NBC?

        GEORGE: (little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.

        Elaine looks heavenwards.

        JERRY: Ah. But they told us we must go now.

        GEORGE: But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, 
        that
        love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.

        George opens the door. Jerry comes over before he can leave.

        JERRY: Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever 
        it
        is. (vehement) Just take it!

        George smiles, claps Jerry on the shoulder and leaves. Jerry starts to 
        close
        the door, but George turns back.

        GEORGE: Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?

        JERRY: Who?

        GEORGE: The network executive. You think she liked me?

        Jerry swings the door closed in George's face.


        [Hallway]

        George crosses the hall to Kramer's door. He knocks, but there is no
        immediate reply. George listens, and can hear excited shouting and laughter.
        He opens the door and goes in.


        [Kramer's Apartment]

        Kramer and the three Japanese sit in the hot-tub. They're stripped to 
        the
        waist (at least), wearing Stetsons, and drinking sake. They spot George 
        as he
        enters and shout greetings.

        KRAMER: Heyy! Look who's here.

        The Japanese whoop and wave at George.

        KRAMER: (beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.

        All the Japanese gesture and shout that George should get in the tub with
        them.

        MR OH: Come on in, fat boy!

        George waves away their appeals with a smile.

        GEORGE: Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day
        tomorrow!

        Kramer and the Japanese cheer and splash water at George, who leaves. 
        Then
        they go back to knocking back sake.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry is re-signing all the checks he dried out.

        JERRY: (to himself) Last one.


        Jerry completes his signature and drops the pen from his claw-like hand. 
        It's
        clearly painful.

        JERRY: (agonised) Uugh! Ahh.


        [Street]

        George stands outside the Nakahama Broadcast Corp offices. He's waiting 
        for
        someone. Kramer wanders up behind him and speaks into George's ear.

        KRAMER: There you are.

        George jumps, surprised by Kramer.

        GEORGE: Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys?

        KRAMER: Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.

        Kramer reaches into his pocket and pulls out a number of airline tickets.

        KRAMER: I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need 
        a
        little food money.

        GEORGE: (horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!

        KRAMER: No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in 
        that
        hot-tub.

        A panicky George rushes toward a payphone.

        GEORGE: (frantic) I'm calling Jerry.


        [Street/Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry is bathing his crippled left hand in a bowl of ice-water. The phone
        rings and he picks up (with his right).

        JERRY: Yeah?

        GEORGE: (panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the
        hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or 
        I
        don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!

        JERRY: (kidding) Uncle Leo?

        GEORGE: (scream) Jerry!!

        George begins hammering the phone against the kiosk. Jerry lifts the phone
        away from his ear at the noise.

        JERRY: Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.

        Jerry hangs up the phone.

        JERRY: (to himself) Hmm, testy.


        [Kramer's Apartment]

        The chest of drawers still stands against one wall. All the drawers are 
        shut,
        and from within them can be heard thumping noises and cries for help. 
        Jerry
        enters and hears the calls.

        JERRY: Hello?

        MR OH (O.C.): Mr Jerry! Open the drawer, please!

        Jerry pulls at the handle with his good hand, but it won't move. He tries 
        to
        hook his bad hand round the other handle and pull.

        JERRY: It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped 
        the
        wood.

        MR OH (O.C.): Pull harder.

        JERRY: I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.

        MR OH (O.C): Very funny, but no joking, please.

        JERRY: (looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.



        [Hallway]

        Elaine and Brett stroll up to Jerry's door. Brett is carrying an umbrella.
        Elaine looks dubious.

        ELAINE: Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.

        BRETT: Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice 
        as
        Kramer's cabinet, but it's start.

        ELAINE: Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.

        Elaine reaches for Jerry's doorhandle, but a shout from Kramer's apartment
        distracts her.

        JERRY (O.C.): (yell) Move to the back of the drawers!

        Elaine moves to enter Kramer's apartment.

        ELAINE: Jerry?


        [Kramer's Apartment]

        Elaine enters followed by Brett.

        ELAINE: Jerry.

        Jerry stands in front of the chest of drawers, holding a large fireman's 
        axe.
        He swings it high and smashes it into the top of the chest, the wood
        splintering under the impact. Brett looks horrified. He drops the umbrella,
        and rushes forward to protect the furniture.

        BRETT: (shouting) Not the Farbman!!

        Elaine stares after the charging Brett. She puts her hand to her mouth 
        and
        screams, horrified at what she sees.


        [Japanese TV Office]

        The Japanese tourists sit on the couch, looking like survivors of some
        horrible ordeal, with the two executives in their chairs. George perches 
        on
        the arm of the couch.

        MR OH: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Jerry Seinfeld is a dangerous lunatic. 
        He
        wouldn't let us out of the drawers. Then he came at me with an axe.

        EXECUTIVE 1: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: We suspect his friend here is 
        also
        unbalanced.

        The tourists turn slowly and look nervously at the smiling, uncomprehending,
        George.

        GEORGE: So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?

        MR OH: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Could we have a couple of those oranges?

        The executives gesture their assent. The tourists eagerly grab the fruit.

        MR OH: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: We are very hungry and have survived 
        many
        hardships.

        Behind the couch, two of the carpet cleaner people enter, including the
        leader. They walk over to a corner. George notices them and stands.

        GEORGE: (to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet
        Cleaners?

        EXECUTIVE 1: Yes. Cleaned up the (points) coffee stain, left by Jerry
        Seinfield.

        Wilhelm enters, dressed in the same yellow overall as the other carpet
        cleaners. George looks stunned.

        GEORGE: Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?

        WILHELM: I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. 
        And,
        one day, we will do the cleaning.

        George lets this sink in, then slowly turns to the leader.

        GEORGE: (incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got 
        that I
        don't have?!

        The leader shrugs, as if to say 'You work it out.'

        GEORGE: (urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr
        Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!

        WILHELM: Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.

        George purses his lips.

        EXECUTIVE 1: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: With these two idiots I don't 
        know
        how the Yankees won the World Series.


        The second executive shakes her head.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Brett sits next to Jerry's table, looking dazed. Elaine stands beside 
        him,
        applying an icepack to his temple. Jerry stands opposite Eaine.

        JERRY: (apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to 
        hit
        you in the head with.. an axe.

        Elaine gives Jerry a look.

        JERRY: (defensive) At least it was just the handle!

        BRETT: It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...

        Brett looks concerned.

        BRETT: I can't remember his name!

        JERRY: Fleckman?

        ELAINE: Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. 
        (holds
        Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'

        ELAINE/JERRY: (singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you,
        before it's too...'

        Brett slips out from under the icepack and falls face-first onto the table
        with an audible clunk. Elaine looks down, shocked. Jerry just looks down.


        [Insert]

        An ambulance races through the streets of New York, siren wailing.


        [Emergency Room]

        Brett lays on his back, as a doctor and nurse examine him.

        NURSE: His pulse is fine.

        DOCTOR: Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to
        relieve the swelling.

        Music begins to play. It's Witchy Woman, and the doctor gets the same 
        look on
        his face as Brett with Desperado. He looks off into the distance.

        NURSE: Doctor?

        The doctor stares away.

        NURSE: (concerned) Doctor?

        The doctor is oblivious to the nurse.

        NURSE: (worried) Doctor?

        There is still no response from the doctor.

        NURSE: (alarm) Doctor, I think we're losing him!

        As the doctor stares off into the distance, the monitoring instruments 
        can be
        heard beeping faster and faster.

        [Kramer's Apartment]

        Kramer and Emily are in bed, having just finished their lovemaking. They're
        both looking very satisfied and smiling.

        KRAMER: Well, that was alright, huh?

        EMILY: Yeah.

        KRAMER: Well, um, goodnight.

        EMILY: Goodnight.

        Kramer rolls over to go to sleep. The bedside clock reads 12:30. Emily
        snuggles up to him and puts an arm around him. Kramer doesn't look
        comfortable with this.

        [Kramer's Apartment, Later]

        The clock reads 3:31. Kramer is lying on his back, sleeping. Beside him,
        Emily lies face-down, sleeping, with her arms flung out wide. One hand 
        is on
        the pillow above Kramer's head, then it moves and Emily's forearm runs
        across Kramer's face, waking him. Kramer looks disgruntled at being
        awakened.

        KRAMER: (quietly, to himself) Look at this.

        He picks up Emily's hand and moves it back to the pillow behind his head,
        only for the same thing to happen again. Emily's hand moves across his 
        face.
        Kramer looks unhappy at the disturbance.

        [Kramer's Apartment, Later Still]

        The clock reads 5:11. A wide awake Kramer is right over to the edge of 
        the
        bed, with Emily cuddled up to him, sleeping happily. Kramer tries to
        carefully move, so as to not wake Emily, but as he shifts his weight, 
        he
        slips off the end of the mattress and falls to the floor. Emily rolls 
        into
        the space vacated, continuing to sleep.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry and his parents enter, carrying a selection of luggage.

        HELEN: Jerry, we can only stay four days.

        JERRY: Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.

        Morty and Helen remove their coats.

        MORTY: Helen, did you pack my travel gym?

        HELEN: Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the
        television. He does it every morning at four.

        MORTY: Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any
        doorknob.

        JERRY: Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.

        Jerry carries two cases through into the bedroom as his parents sit on 
        the
        couch.

        HELEN: Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.

        Jerry reenters.

        JERRY: Am I finally getting a baby brother?

        HELEN: Jerry, be serious.

        MORTY: How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?

        JERRY: What? The Cadillac I bought for you?

        MORTY: It's too much car, Jerry.

        JERRY: Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?

        MORTY: I don't think we even use it.

        JERRY: Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.

        HELEN: We already sold it.

        JERRY: Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?

        MORTY: Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until 
        now.

        HELEN: Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.

        JERRY: (exasperated) Ugh.

        Jerry turns away towards the kitchen as Kramer enters.

        KRAMER: (to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.

        JERRY: Kramer.

        KRAMER: No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen)
        Heyy! Seinfelds.

        HELEN: Hi Kramer.

        MORTY: Hiya Kramer.

        JERRY: We're in the middle of a discussion here.

        KRAMER: Oh yeah? What about?

        HELEN: Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.

        KRAMER: What'd you get for it?

        MORTY: Jack Klompus gave us six grand.

        Kramer whistles, impressed

        JERRY: You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?

        Morty rises from the couch, taking a cheque out of his pocket.

        MORTY: (trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the
        money.

        JERRY: (getting worked up) I don't need the money.

        MORTY: What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.

        JERRY: (animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque 
        and
        you sold a Cadillac?!

        HELEN: Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs 
        in
        her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is 
        not
        what it used to be, what with def jam and all.

        Helen passes the clipping to Jerry.

        KRAMER: Yeah, that def jam is a force.

        HELEN: Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales'
        executive training program.


        JERRY: (sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.

        KRAMER: Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you 
        had
        some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that
        could be the next wave.

        Jerry lets out an exasperated groan, as Helen rubs his back.


        [Fresh Roasted Coffee Store]

        Jerry and Elaine have cups of coffee, George is ordering his beans from 
        the
        guy behind the counter.

        GEORGE: Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.

        The counterperson nods to George, and moves to fill the order.

        ELAINE: So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?

        GEORGE: I'm going to the bathroom.

        George leaves.

        ELAINE: Just, very interesting.

        JERRY: Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.

        The guy behind the counter brings a bag of coffee over.

        COUNTERPERSON: Arabian mocha java?

        ELAINE: (looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.

        Elaine takes the bag and pays for it.

        JERRY: That Arabian is strong coffee.

        ELAINE: It's PLO blend.

        George rejoins the gang.

        ELAINE: Ohh, I got your coffee.

        Elaine proffers the bag to George. He takes it and reaches for his pocket.

        GEORGE: Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...

        ELAINE: (waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, 
        man.
        Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll 
        see
        you, okay? (begins to walk away)

        GEORGE: Yeah.

        ELAINE: Bye.

        GEORGE: Mmm.

        Elaine leaves. Jerry moves to wander out of the store also, when George
        stops him.

        GEORGE: You see what just happened here?

        JERRY: What?

        GEORGE: She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.

        JERRY: And you misinterpret this how?

        GEORGE: She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.

        JERRY: I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.

        GEORGE: No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.

        JERRY: You're crazy.

        GEORGE: (worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry.

        JERRY: George.

        GEORGE: (angry) Stickin' it!

        George walks off, pulling an angry face.


        [Monk's]

        Jerry and George sit in a booth.

        GEORGE: So you're buying the car back for your parents?

        JERRY: I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.

        GEORGE: Your parents'll never let you do it.

        JERRY: They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying
        it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.

        GEORGE: What kind of money you think your parents have?

        JERRY: Excuse me?

        GEORGE: I bet they have more money than mine.

        JERRY: Come on, your parents have money.

        GEORGE: You think?

        JERRY: When did they ever spend any money?

        GEORGE: Never.

        JERRY: What are their living expenses?

        GEORGE: Nothing.

        JERRY: Where do they ever go on vacation?

        GEORGE: Nowhere.

        Jerry gives a little 'you do the math' shrug to George.

        GEORGE: How much money d'you think they have?

        JERRY: Few hundred grand?

        GEORGE: (excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand
        dollars, is that what you're saying?!

        JERRY: Course you may not see it for twenty years.

        GEORGE: Twenty years? That long?

        JERRY: Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?

        GEORGE: Fortunately, yes.

        JERRY: How's your family history?

        GEORGE: I have an aunt that died at seven.

        JERRY: Really?

        GEORGE: Aunt Baby.


        [Elaine's Office]

        Elaine sits behind her desk, in the big fancy office she gets standing 
        in
        for Peterman as president. Kramer enters.

        KRAMER: Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?

        ELAINE: Yeah, Kramer, come on in.

        KRAMER: I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.

        Kramer sits in front of Elaine's desk.

        ELAINE: (unsure) Oh-kay.

        KRAMER: (a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, 
        I
        don't want her in the bed any more.

        ELAINE: Ah.

        KRAMER: Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the 
        jimmy
        legs.

        ELAINE: (confused) Jimmy legs?

        Kramer raises one leg and judders it in the air, as illustration.

        KRAMER: Jimmy leg.

        ELAINE: (grasping the concept) Ohh.

        KRAMER: So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?

        ELAINE: Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?

        KRAMER: Well, I'd say it nicely.

        ELAINE: I don't think so.

        KRAMER: Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think 
        if
        I could just work out this one thing...

        ELAINE: (interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might 
        be
        more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.


        KRAMER: Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.

        ELAINE: (pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.

        Kramer starts to move, and thumps his knee on the underside of the desk. 
        He
        rises and begins to head for the door.

        ELAINE: (impatient) Get out!


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Morty and Helen sit on the couch, watching TV and doing a crossword,
        respectively. Jerry enters from the bedroom, carrying a suitcase.

        JERRY: So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at
        Bally's.

        MORTY: You just heard about this today?

        JERRY: (pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly
        called me.

        HELEN: Who cancelled?

        JERRY: Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.


        [The Costanza Home, Queens]

        George and his parents are seated at the table in the kitchen, eating 
        a meal
        of spaghetti.

        GEORGE: I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt 
        Baby.

        FRANK: (looks up to heaven) She's deceased.

        GEORGE: (glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?

        FRANK: (looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.

        GEORGE: Is that common in our family?

        ESTELLE: Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.

        FRANK: Also internal problems.

        ESTELLE: It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and
        then one day, they're all gone.

        FRANK: What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly
        from the moment I met her!

        ESTELLE: (shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie!

        GEORGE: I guess you two are the lucky ones.

        FRANK: So far.

        ESTELLE: Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?

        FRANK: She'd never make it.

        George thinks a little and looks hopeful.


        [Monk's]

        Kramer and Emily sit at a table. Emily looks a little angry.

        EMILY: So let me get this straight. You enjoy the lovemaking...

        KRAMER: Shh, shh.

        EMILY: (quieter) Well, do you?

        KRAMER: Oh yeah, like strawberry pie.

        EMILY: Okay, but you have a problem sharing a bed with me?

        KRAMER: I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack
        time, I'm a zombie.

        EMILY: I don't know.

        KRAMER: (pleading) Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway.

        EMILY: You're not easy, Kramer.

        KRAMER: I know.


        [Animation]

        On a map of the East Coast of the US, a long red arrow appears from New 
        York
        to Del Boca Vista.


        [Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista]

        Jerry sits on a chair as Jack, standing, speaks.

        JACK: So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?

        JERRY: I wanna buy back the Cadillac.

        JACK: You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?

        Jack chuckles at his own joke. Jerry stares back at him, unamused.

        JACK: I'm kidding.

        JERRY: (reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand 
        for
        it.

        Jerry puts is chequebook on the table

        JACK: Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.

        JERRY: You bought it for six!

        JACK: You're not me.

        JERRY: (standing) How much d'you want for it?

        JACK: The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.

        Jerry pulls a 'you have to be kidding' face.

        JERRY: Fourteen thousand.

        JACK: Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go 
        to
        Naples.

        Jerry starts to write the cheque, but his pen is obviously not working
        properly. Jack pulls out his own pen (the astronaut pen from 'The Pen') 
        and
        offers it to Jerry.

        JACK: Need a pen?

        Jerry scribbles with his pen, to try and encourage it, but to no avail. 
        He
        looks to Jack, who's holding out his pen.

        JACK: Still works.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Morty and Helen are by the counter, as Kramer comes in.

        KRAMER: Hey, where's Jerry?

        HELEN: He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.

        KRAMER: Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need 
        his
        shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the 
        phone
        to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry
        Seinfeld's room, please.

        MORTY: You know that number?

        KRAMER: I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, 
        he's
        not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...

        HELEN: F. F, E, L , D.

        KRAMER: ...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens)
        Alright, you have a lucky day, too.

        Kramer rings off.

        HELEN: He's not there?

        KRAMER: No, they never heard of him.

        Kramer puts down the phone, and walks off to look for the shoeshine kit.
        Morty and Helen exchange worried looks.


        [Restaurant]

        George, Elaine and Jerry's parents sit at a table in a fancy restaurant.

        ELAINE: This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.

        GEORGE: (oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the
        good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money 
        on

        the people I care about.

        HELEN: Where's Jerry?

        GEORGE: Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table 
        and
        brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian
        mocha java.

        George puts the gift in front of Elaine.

        ELAINE: George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company.
        I can afford to buy you coffee.

        MORTY: (surprised) President?

        ELAINE: Yeah.

        Jerry enters, with his bag over his shoulder.

        GEORGE: Hey look, he's back.

        JERRY: I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic 
        City.

        HELEN: Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.

        JERRY: (extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was
        registered under Slappy White.

        Helen looks unconvinced. A spiffily-dressed Frank and Estelle enter the
        restaurant and are spotted by George.

        GEORGE: Mom? Dad?

        ESTELLE: Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.

        Morty half-nods a greeting.

        GEORGE: Wh..what're you doing here?

        FRANK: We're having an upscale dinner.

        GEORGE: What?

        ESTELLE: Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much 
        time
        left.

        FRANK: So, we're blowing it all.

        George looks unhappy at this news.

        FRANK: (holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.


        [Emily's Apartment]

        Once again, Kramer and Emily are basking in the afterglow.

        KRAMER: That was alright.

        EMILY: Yeah.

        They both lie still for a few seconds.

        KRAMER: (abruptly) Well, I'll see you.

        Kramer climbs quickly out of the bed to leave.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Morty, dressed in exercise gear, emerges from the bedroom. He is carrying
        the travel gym. He creeps across the room, so as not to wake Jerry, who 
        is
        asleep on the couch, quietly opens the door and slips outside.


        [Kramer's Apartment/Hallway]

        Kramer is asleep in his bed, when something wakes him. He can hear a
        thumping and a rattling sound. Kramer turns over and looks across at his
        door, to see the handle turning, as if someone outside were trying to 
        open
        it. A look of horror comes to Kramer's face.

        Outside in the hallway, Morty has his travel gym attached to Kramer's
        doorknob. As he pulls on the arrangement of cords and pulleys, they in 
        turn
        pull at the doorknob.

        Inside Kramer's apartment, a terrified Kramer pulls the blankets over 
        his
        head and lies quivering underneath.


        [Jerry's Apartment/Florida]

        Morty and Helen are eating at the table. The phone rings and Jerry answers.

        JERRY: Hello.

        A dishevelled and muddy Jack Klompus is on the other end of the line, 
        using
        a cellular phone somewhere outdoors in Florida.

        JACK: (shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap 
        with
        the car.

        The front portion of the Cadillac is submerged in a swamp, with the tail 
        end
        pointed upwards.

        JACK: I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.

        Jerry tries not to give anything away to his parents.

        JERRY: (quiet) Huh. Alright.

        Jerry puts down the phone and moves towards the bedroom.

        HELEN: Who was that?

        JERRY: (extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City.
        They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for
        tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.

        Jerry leaves to the bedroom. Helen and Morty don't look convinced by Jerry's
        spiel. They talk quietly so's Jerry can't hear in the next room.

        MORTY: That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.

        HELEN: I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?

        MORTY: I'd have to go back to work.

        HELEN: Where would you work?

        MORTY: Maybe I should talk to Elaine.


        [Elaine's Office]

        Elaine sits behind her desk, interviewing a smartly dressed Morty.

        ELAINE: Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a 
        job
        here.

        MORTY: What's not to understand?

        ELAINE: Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.

        MORTY: I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we 
        have
        a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.

        ELAINE: (looking around her desk) Where is your resume?

        MORTY: I don't have it. I'll mail you one.

        ELAINE: Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have 
        in
        mind?

        MORTY: You sell clothes here, don't you?

        ELAINE: Yeah.

        MORTY: Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years.
        In nineteen forty-nine...

        ELAINE: (interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow,
        we'll find something for you to do.

        MORTY: You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I 
        get up
        at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.

        ELAINE: Uhm...

        Peterman enters the office.

        PETERMAN: (upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black 
        Forest
        ham.

        Peterman strides across the office to another door.

        ELAINE: (stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back.

        Peterman goes through the other door, and closes it behind him. Elaine,
        stands, her mouth agape in shock.

        MORTY: Who's Mr Fancy?


        [Emily's Apartment]


        Kramer and Emily in bed again.

        KRAMER: (hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.

        EMILY: Aww, that's sweet, but actually I, I think I'd prefer it if you 
        left.

        KRAMER: (surprise) What?

        EMILY: You were completely right. I sleep so much better when I'm alone.
        (pause) And you scream in your sleep.

        KRAMER: I do?

        Kramer looks intensely nervous.

        KRAMER: (fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment
        last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.

        EMILY: C'mon, it was probably the wind.

        KRAMER: No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen,
        you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and
        I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.

        EMILY: (adamant) Well, I do.


        [Animation]

        Another arrow is drawn from New York to Del Boca Vista.


        [Street, Del Boca Vista]

        A tow truck has hauled the Cadillac out of the swamp and back to Del Boca
        Vista. It's plastered with mud and filth over its entire length. Jack
        Klompus stands beside it, still mud-spattered. Jerry climbs out of a cab.

        JACK: What took you so long?

        JERRY: I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?

        The cab drives away.

        JACK: This thing is a, is a behemoth.

        JERRY: What did you do?

        JACK: I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker
        and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm
        telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.

        Jerry opens the door of the Cadillac and a torrent of muddy water containing
        a couple of catfish spills out over his feet.

        JERRY: (exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car
        cleaned up for my parents.

        JACK: (shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.

        JERRY: My car? You drove it into the swamp!

        JACK: It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, 
        too.

        JERRY: (smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all
        worthwhile.


        [The Costanza Home, Queens]

        Frank and Estelle sit in the living room as George walks in from the front
        door.

        GEORGE: (pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of 
        the
        house?

        FRANK: That's your mother's new car.

        GEORGE: You bought that?

        FRANK: It's a Coupe de Elegance.

        ESTELLE: Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.

        George looks like he's going to say something, but then the door to the
        kitchen opens and Kramer walks in, wearing a dressing gown and pyjamas 
        and
        carrying a mug of coffee. He slaps George on the back.

        KRAMER: Mornin'.

        Kramer walks round the stunned George, and sits on the couch.

        KRAMER: Oh, boy.

        GEORGE: What the hell is going on here?

        KRAMER: I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at 
        night
        to sleep.

        ESTELLE: George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have
        been talking.

        GEORGE: (dread) Oh god.

        KRAMER: Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this
        community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place
        where they should be.

        FRANK: (claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.

        GEORGE: Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida
        again?!

        ESTELLE: Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit 
        on
        the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?

        George looks surprised, confused and thoughtful, all at the same time.


        [Peterman's Office]

        Peterman sits behind his desk in the office which was, until recently,
        Elaine's. Employees sit around the desk, including Morty and Elaine, who
        sits depressed at the end of the desk.

        PETERMAN: So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to 
        her
        old position, at her original salary...

        Elaine does a double take at this, and looks unhappy.

        PETERMAN: ...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on 
        a
        job... done.

        ELAINE: (hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?

        PETERMAN: I think not.

        Elaine puts a hand to her head and sighs.

        PETERMAN: Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of 
        a
        diaphanous rum-runner scarf.

        The employees take notes.

        ELAINE: Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for 
        about
        a thousand dollars a bolt.

        MORTY: (shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on
        Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.

        ELAINE: (tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans.

        MORTY: What?

        PETERMAN: (puzzled) Who are you?

        ELAINE: Don't worry, I...

        MORTY: Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.

        ELAINE: Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...

        PETERMAN: Elaine, did you hire this man?

        ELAINE: (worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern,
        you know, at best.


        [Monk's]

        George and Elaine sit in a booth.

        ELAINE: So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.

        GEORGE: (pointing out the positive) But happy.

        ELAINE: Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...

        Elaine gestures with her hand.

        GEORGE: Obviously.

        ELAINE: Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.

        GEORGE: No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't
        solved anything yet.

        ELAINE: Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.


        GEORGE: What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.

        ELAINE: Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...

        GEORGE: (upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, 
        you
        could humour me. He humours me.

        ELAINE: Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at
        Peterman's.

        GEORGE: You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys 
        is
        breathing down my neck?

        ELAINE: What?

        GEORGE: You schedule a late meeting.

        ELAINE: (puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?

        GEORGE: These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped.
        (animated) How did we get back onto you?!

        ELAINE: (grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.

        Elaine gets up and leaves.

        GEORGE: (shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!


        [The Costanza Home, Queens]

        Kramer, wrapped in a quilt enters the Costanza's bedroom. Frank enters 
        from
        the bathroom, drying his hands with a towel.

        KRAMER: Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.

        FRANK: That's right. That's me on the left.

        KRAMER: So, you sleep in separate beds.

        FRANK: Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way 
        I
        could get some rest.

        KRAMER: (intrigued) Really?

        FRANK: (confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.

        KRAMER: You can get that in your arms?

        FRANK: Like you wouldn't believe.


        [Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista]

        A grubby Jerry sits at the table, with Jack hovering over him.

        JACK: Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made 
        all
        your phone calls. Why are you still here?

        JERRY: Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough 
        cash
        for a hotel room. So...

        JACK: You are uh, thinking of staying here?

        JERRY: Well...

        JACK: (laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that
        death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!

        JERRY: You didn't like that crack about the pen.

        JACK: I did not.


        [The Costanza Home, Queens]

        George and his parents sit at the kitchen table, while Kramer does some
        washing up in the sink.

        GEORGE: Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...

        George is distracted momentarily by Kramer clattering dishes. He gives
        Kramer a look and continues.

        GEORGE: (attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you
        living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too
        much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.

        FRANK: It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving
        tonight.

        Estelle and Frank smile at each other.

        GEORGE: (crestfallen) But you said it was my call.

        ESTELLE: We were just being nice.

        George looks crushed.

        ESTELLE: (motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright 
        here
        alone?

        KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.

        GEORGE: (animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!

        FRANK: He's not family. It's different, psychologically.

        Kramer is examining the label on a wine bottle, as George turns to look 
        at
        him. He gives George a little smile.


        [Peterman's Office]

        The employees, including Elaine and Morty, sit round Peterman's desk as 
        he
        waxes lyrical about his adventures. Morty looks impatient, glancing at 
        his
        watch as Peterman speaks.

        PETERMAN: And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped 
        that
        great rhino right in his tracks.

        MORTY: Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...

        ELAINE: Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced
        mortal danger.

        PETERMAN: (smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.

        MORTY: Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can 
        we
        at least get some food here?

        PETERMAN: (looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that
        same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...

        MORTY: (standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's
        close to finish with his story.

        Morty heads for the door. Peterman's voice brings him to a halt.

        PETERMAN: Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.

        MORTY: Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.

        PETERMAN: (winks) Morty, you're out.

        MORTY: (unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with
        those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.

        Morty walks out, leaving a not entirely unhappy Elaine behind.


        [Animation]

        An arrow is drawn on the East Coast map, this time from Queens to Del 
        Boca
        Vista.


        [Street, Del Boca Vista]

        Frank walks along the sidewalk, past a familiar looking Cadillac. Something
        catches his eye, and he looks into the car. A figure is asleep on the 
        back
        seat with his face covered. Frank 'gives a what is the world coming to' 
        look
        and throws up his hands as he walks away.

        After he leaves, the figure shifts in his sleep, turning over. It's Jerry,
        sleeping in his parent's Cadillac.


        [The Costanza Home, Queens]

        Kramer stands in the doorway of the bathroom, while Emily sits on Estelle's
        bed, reading a paperback.

        KRAMER: I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at
        Snitzer's.

        EMILY: (not looking up from her book) No-one held a gun to your head.

        KRAMER: (dismissive) Yeah.

        EMILY: (still reading) Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's
        tomorrow night.

        KRAMER: (moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.


        EMILY: You like 'em.

        KRAMER: I've had it with 'em.

        Kramer disappears into the bathroom.

        EMILY: Then we won't go.

        Kramer reemerges with a glass of water.

        KRAMER: (yielding) Okay, okay. What time?

        EMILY: Eight thirty.

        Kramer downs the glass of water in one go, and then belches.

        KRAMER: (satisfied) Ahh. That was alright.

        Emily smiles at him, then returns to her book.


        [Monk's]

        Jerry, George and Elaine sit in a booth. Jerry drinking coffee, George
        eating and Elaine reading from the pages of a newspaper.

        ELAINE: 'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer 
        J
        Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and 
        a
        half points.'

        Elaine folds the paper and drops it on the table.

        JERRY: Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...

        ELAINE: (downcast) Yeah.

        GEORGE: (Jerry-style) That's a shame.

        ELAINE: (sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?

        GEORGE: (innocent) What?

        ELAINE: I think you're sticking it to me.

        JERRY: Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.

        ELAINE: (leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!

        George doesn't meet Elaine's stare.

        JERRY: You're not alone. I'm practically broke.

        ELAINE: Really?

        JERRY: No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.

        George takes another forkful of what's on his plate.

        GEORGE: (relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.

        JERRY: Well, you seem happy.

        GEORGE: I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking
        in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!

        ELAINE: So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?

        JERRY: Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.

        ELAINE: Hmm.


        [Florida]

        Morty and Helen sit on a couch, reading magazines.

        MORTY: When are we gonna tell Jerry?

        HELEN: I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.

        MORTY: He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting
        away with that.

        It's revealed that the Seinfelds are in a trailer parked behind the
        Cadillac.

        HELEN: Besides, that condo was too much house.


        [The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista]

        Estelle is sitting on the couch in the condo, while Frank peers out of 
        the
        window.

        ESTELLE: How many times can you check the car?

        FRANK: (coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac 
        the
        other day.

        Frank sits in a chair.

        ESTELLE: Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?

        FRANK: They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!

        ESTELLE: (shouts) You're driving me crazy!

        FRANK: (standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands)
        Where's my hat?

        Frank walks out of the room.

        ESTELLE: (shouts) Nooh!

        [Yankee Stadium, Conference Room]

        A group of staff, including George, are gathered round the table. There's 
        a
        bunch of food on the table. Most people have a small plate with a few 
        salad
        leaves on it in front of them. George is picking shrimp off a platter,
        dipping them in some sort of sauce, and stuffing his face with them, about 
        as
        fast as he can manage.

        BILL: Well, if the big man wants a new scoreboard, I don't wanna be the 
        one
        to tell him no.

        REILLY: No-one in the park is gonna be able to see it from there.

        GEORGE: (through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor
        in his skybox?

        REILLY: Hey George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.

        Everyone at the table starts laughing uproariously at Reilly's joke. George
        looks upset, and barely forces half a sick smile past his mouthful of
        seafood.


        [George's Car]

        George drives along. He's fuming at Reilly's dig.

        GEORGE: (angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta
        shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated
        shout) Dammit!


        [New York Health & Racquet Club]

        George and Jerry come along a corridor. They're carrying bags and
        paraphernalia indicating they've been playing tennis.

        JERRY: 'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?

        GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the 
        jerk
        store called, and they're running outta you.'

        Jerry and George halt at a bench by the entrance to the pro shop. Jerry
        rummages in his bag, producing an old-fashioned wooden framed tennis racquet.

        JERRY: (smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?

        GEORGE: (confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.

        JERRY: Oh. That's not quite the same.

        GEORGE: No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.

        JERRY: I'm gonna grab a can of balls.

        GEORGE: Right.

        George heads on down the corridor. Jerry walks into the pro shop, carrying
        his gear. There are a few customers browsing. Milos (East European, tracksuit
        wearing, slicked back hair with pony tail) comes over to Jerry.

        MILOS: Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you.

        JERRY: I need a can of balls.

        Jerry stands before the counter, holding the old-fashioned racquet. Milos
        reaches under the counter and pulls out a can of tennis balls.

        MILOS: Can of balls for the nice guy, alri...

        Milos stops and stares disapprovingly at Jerry's racquet.

        MILOS: ...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do 
        you?

        Jerry looks surprised.


        [Champagne Video]

        Inside a typical small video rental store, Elaine stands before a rack 
        marked
        'Staff Picks'. Individual shelves are labelled 'Elizabeth', 'Gene', and
        'Vincent', amongst others. Elaine is reading the back of a video box, 
        when
        Kramer comes up behind her.

        KRAMER: Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?

        ELAINE: Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent
        guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.

        KRAMER: Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.

        ELAINE: Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.

        KRAMER: (indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a 
        Kramer
        pick.

        Kramer holds up a video for Elaine's inspection.

        ELAINE: (reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of 
        that
        one.

        KRAMER: Yeah, went straight to video.

        Elaine looks upon this as a negative.

        KRAMER: (positive) That makes me the premiere.

        Kramer takes his cassette toward the counter.

        ELAINE: (gets Kramer's point) Hah.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Kramer is talking seriously to Jerry, whilst holding a piece of paper.

        KRAMER: Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?

        JERRY: No. <img src="http://tinyurl.com/2rau"> 
        

        KRAMER: It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching
        it, so I want you to read this.

        Kramer hands the piece of paper to Jerry.

        JERRY: (reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other 
        Side
        Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie,
        hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine,
        lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'

        KRAMER: Can you do that for me, buddy?

        JERRY: Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding
        document.

        KRAMER: Well, I'm gonna type it up.

        JERRY: Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.


        KRAMER: Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me.
        (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I
        couldn't even give him his Christmas present.

        Jerry nods sympathetically. Kramer spots something on the table.

        KRAMER: Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?

        JERRY: Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this 
        guy
        Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.

        Kramer takes a few practice strokes with the racquet.

        JERRY: In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.

        KRAMER: (picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this 
        any
        more.

        Kramer deposits the old wooden racquet in Jerry's trash. Jerry notices
        something about the piece of paper Kramer gave him.

        JERRY: (accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.

        KRAMER: (explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures
        page.

        Kramer swings the new racquet again, making ball-smashing sound effects.


        [Elaine's Apartment]

        Elaine sits up in bed, watching her video rental. She dabs a tear from 
        her
        eye, and sniffs.

        ELAINE: (emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs)

        The phone rings. Elaine reaches over and picks up, not happy at being
        interrupted.

        ELAINE: What?

        VINCENT (O.C.): Did you enjoy the movie?

        ELAINE: Who is it?

        VINCENT (O.C.): It's Vincent.

        ELAINE: Of Vincent's picks?

        VINCENT (O.C.): The same.

        Elaine smiles excitedly.


        [Tennis Club]

        Elaine and Jerry have been playing tennis at a different club from the 
        one we
        saw earlier. They're packing away their stuff. At another court, behind 
        them,
        a guy in baseball cap and dark glasses is playing truly awful tennis. 
        He's
        missing the ball, falling over, flailing wildly with his racquet.

        JERRY: He called you?

        ELAINE: He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for,
        like, two hours.

        JERRY: To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process 
        is
        getting ever more rigorous.

        Elaine sticks out her tongue at Jerry.

        ELAINE: Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he 
        sets
        his own hours.

        A tennis ball bounces by Elaine, and she grabs it. The terrible player 
        from
        the other court shouts over.

        PLAYER (O.C.): Little help, hey!

        ELAINE: (tossing the ball back) Yeah.

        PLAYER: Thank you.

        The ball Elaine tossed back eludes the player's grasp, misses his racquet 
        and
        bounces away past him.

        ELAINE: (laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.

        JERRY: (pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm.

        The terrible player continues to swing ineffectually at easy balls in 
        the
        background.

        ELAINE: Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?

        JERRY: George used up all my guest passes already.

        ELAINE: Ah.

        PLAYER: Ahh.

        A ball bounces past Elaine, and Jerry grabs it.

        JERRY: Come on.

        PLAYER: Thank you.

        The awful player comes over to get the ball back. As he approaches, he
        removes his sunglasses and wipes his brow with his forearm.

        JERRY: (tossing the ball) Here you go.

        The player catches the ball and raises his head, so we can see his face. 
        It's
        Milos, the guy who sold Jerry his new racquet.

        JERRY: (disbelief) Milos?

        MILOS: (shock) Oh, hey. (puts sunglasses back on) How you doing?

        Milos looks guilty, and shouts across to his playing partner as he walks 
        away
        from Jerry.

        MILOS: Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here.

        Milos bounces the ball on the court and tries to hit it over the net. 
        He
        fails, despite being no more than four feet from the net. Jerry looks 
        down at
        his new racquet, thoughtfully.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Elaine and Jerry have just arrived from the tennis club, and are putting
        their stuff on the table. Elaine is removing her coat.

        ELAINE: So he was bad. What d'you care?

        JERRY: Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he 
        said
        it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with 
        a log.

        The door opens and Kramer enters, smartly dressed, with a suit and tie.

        KRAMER: Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's 
        gonna
        set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.

        ELAINE: The executor? Of what?

        JERRY: Kramer wants to die with dignity.

        ELAINE: There's a feather in your cap.

        KRAMER: I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps
        fingers)

        The door opens and George wanders in, looking pleased with himself.

        GEORGE: Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.

        JERRY: D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?

        GEORGE: I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I 
        bet I
        can get him to try that line again.

        ELAINE: Who's Reilly?

        JERRY: George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey,
        George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'

        Elaine laughs, loud and long, causing Jerry and Kramer to smile and laugh.

        GEORGE: Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store
        called. They're running outta you.'

        George smiles and looks expectant. The other three just stare at him, 
        with
        varying levels of confusion in their expressions.

        GEORGE: (worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!

        ELAINE: How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got 
        some
        space to rent.'?


        Elaine laughs, and Jerry smiles.

        GEORGE: (confused) What does that mean?

        JERRY: (taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called.
        You're due back by six.'

        GEORGE: (frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.

        KRAMER: Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.

        GEORGE: (shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.

        KRAMER: Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how
        would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...

        GEORGE: (really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate
        writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and 
        it
        all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with 
        jerk
        store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!

        George walks out the door. The other three watch him go. Kramer walks 
        over
        and looks out the door after George, then returns and spots Jerry's old
        racquet on a stool.

        KRAMER: (picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?

        JERRY: Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.

        KRAMER: Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) 
        How
        are you gonna be the executor of my living will?

        Jerry retrieves the racquet from the trash.

        KRAMER: (indicating) You see? You can't let go.

        JERRY: Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.

        KRAMER: I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free 
        time
        tomorrow afternoon?

        ELAINE: Me?

        KRAMER: Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted
        businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind
        stomping on a few throats.

        ELAINE: (smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon.


        [Lawyer's Office]

        Kramer and Elaine sit before a desk, behind which sits Shellbach the lawyer,
        who has a large list in front of him, from which he's reading. Kramer 
        looks
        nervous, while Elaine is tapping at a soda can, looking bored.

        SHELLBACH: Situation number four. You're breathing on your own, you're
        conscious, but with no muscular function.

        KRAMER: Well, would I be able to communicate?

        SHELLBACH: I don't see how.

        ELAINE: Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.

        KRAMER: Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.

        ELAINE: Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.

        SHELLBACH: Moving on. You have liver, kidneys and gall bladder, but no
        central nervous system.

        Kramer looks at Elaine, who gives a double thumbs-down.

        KRAMER: Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.

        SHELLBACH: Okay. One lung, blind and you're eating through a tube.

        KRAMER: Naw, that's not my style.

        ELAINE: Bore-ing.

        SHELLBACH: Alright, you can eat. But machines do everything else.

        KRAMER: (hesitant) Uhm...

        Kramer looks to Elaine, who nods.

        ELAINE: I'd stick.

        KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee
        shop.

        ELAINE: (points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.


        [New York Health & Racquet Club]

        A grim-looking Jerry stalks into the pro shop and over to the counter 
        to be
        met by a nervous and apologetic Milos.

        JERRY: Hello Milos.

        MILOS: Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming 
        down
        here. Uhm, listen...

        JERRY: (animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because
        I thought you knew what you were talking about.

        MILOS: I..I...

        JERRY: You can't even play.

        MILOS: Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my
        business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership 
        of the
        club? Free. No charge.

        JERRY: You could do that?

        MILOS: Jerry, for you, anything.

        Jerry looks happier. Milos walks away behind the scenes somewhere. Jerry
        looks round the store and exchanges smiles with a beautiful woman who's
        trying on a visor. After a few moments, Milos returns, looking rueful.

        JERRY: (indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?

        MILOS: (apologetic) Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no 
        way
        they can do it. (meek) Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything 
        at
        all. I refund your money.

        JERRY: (animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. 
        I
        just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...

        MILOS: Shhh-shhh. (whispers) I make it up to you.

        JERRY: (doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.

        Jerry turns away and walks toward the door. As he passes the beautiful 
        woman,
        he speaks.

        JERRY: Tennis, anyone?

        The woman smiles at Jerry's flirtation. Jerry leaves, and Milos looks 
        after
        him, worried.


        [Champagne Video]

        Kramer and Elaine stand before the 'Staff Picks' rack again. Elaine picks 
        a
        video off the 'Vincent' rack.

        ELAINE: Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning.
        (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred
        and ninety-two minutes?

        KRAMER: That's a lotta yearning, huh?

        ELAINE: You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally
        exhausting.

        KRAMER: Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.

        ELAINE: Really?

        KRAMER: (looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? 
        (pulls
        down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, 
        that's
        an hilarious premise.

        ELAINE: (laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...

        KRAMER: Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)

        ELAINE: Yeah, I could use a chuckle.

        Elaine returns the 'Vincent' pick to the shelf and walks toward the counter
        with the Bernie's tape.

        KRAMER: (approving) Yeah.

        ELAINE: What're you getting?


        KRAMER: Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.

        ELAINE: Oh. How much you got left?

        KRAMER: Yeah, about two hours.

        Elaine does a double-take at this.

        KRAMER: Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.


        [Elaine's Apartment]

        Elaine sits up in bed, watching her video. She's not enjoying it.

        ELAINE: (at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because
        he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how 
        long
        is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!

        The phone rings, and Elaine picks up, glad of the interruption.

        ELAINE: Hello.

        VINCENT (O.C.): (accusing) How's the movie. Elaine?

        ELAINE: Vincent?

        VINCENT (O.C.): (betrayed) The Gene pick. How could you? I thought we 
        had
        something special.

        ELAINE: (defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind
        it.

        There is a click as Vincent hangs up.

        ELAINE: Vincent?


        [Yankee Stadium, Conference Room]

        The table is ringed with employees again, and there is more food. George 
        is
        stuffing his face with shrimp, just as before. There are a couple of empty
        seats. One more guy (Fred) enters, and moves to sit at the table.

        FRED: Alright, let's get to it.

        GEORGE: Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?

        FRED: Reilly doesn't work here any more.

        GEORGE: (surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that.

        FRED: Oh, we only wake you up for the important meetings.

        Everyone at the table collapses into laughter at George's expense. Again,
        George do nothing but look upset at the turn of events.


        [Street]

        Jerry is walking along the street, when he encounters the beautiful woman
        from the pro shop, who appears to have been waiting from him.

        PATTY: Hello.

        JERRY: Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?

        PATTY: I think so. I'm Patty. Milos gave me your address. I hope you don't
        mind me waiting for you here.

        JERRY: (to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we 
        do,
        uhm, care for a cup of coffee?

        PATTY: Why don't we just go up to your apartment?

        JERRY: (surprised) Alright.

        Patty strolls past Jerry, and indicates he should follow.

        JERRY: (to himself) Gotta be an easier way.

        Jerry turns to follow Patty.

        Kramer is playing the rest of The Other Side Of Darkness. The soundtrack 
        can
        be heard from the TV.

        NURSE (O.C.): Doctor, how's her coma?

        DOCTOR (O.C.): Oh, exactly the same.

        Kramer enters the room, with a bowl of spaghetti. He sits on the couch 
        to
        watch the movie, and lifts a big forkful into his mouth.

        DOCTOR (O.C.): Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.

        Kramer stops chewing and stares wide-eyed at the TV screen.

        DOCTOR (O.C.): Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?

        ALLBRIGHT (O.C.): (bright and cheerful) I feel so rested and refreshed. 
        Get
        me a toothbrush.

        Kramer continues to stare at the screen, stunned by the outcome of the 
        movie.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry hands a drink to Patty as she stands by the kitchen counter.

        JERRY: So, you play tennis?

        PATTY: (putting the glass down on the counter) Enough talk, Jerry.

        Patty advances on Jerry, sexily. Jerry looks somewhat surprised.

        JERRY: Not for me, I love chatting.

        PATTY: (putting her hand to Jerry's face) Shh.

        Patty leans toward Jerry, as though to kiss him. Just as she's about to 
        kiss,
        she breaks away.

        PATTY: (anguished) No! No, I can't do this. (moving away) I can't go through
        with it. (sitting on the couch) Not even for him!

        JERRY: Who?

        PATTY: (cries) Milos. My husband!

        JERRY: (shocked) Your husband?!

        Patty puts her face down on the couch, weeping. Jerry, puts his hands 
        up in
        the air, in a gesture of total disbelief.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        George sits on the couch, just making sure he's got Jerry's story straight.
        Jerry listens.

        GEORGE: So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might 
        leak
        out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?

        JERRY: (explanation) He's new around here.

        GEORGE: (hopeful) So, details?

        JERRY: (walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.

        GEORGE: Because of society, right?

        JERRY: (weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting
        turn out?

        Jerry is getting some sort of candy bar out of a packet on the counter.

        GEORGE: Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?

        George wanders over into the kitchen.

        JERRY: Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.

        George looks in the fridge.

        GEORGE: Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.

        JERRY: You never really had the right comeback, anyway.

        George jerks out of the fridge, slamming the door.

        GEORGE: (animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! 
        Smoked
        him, I say.

        George walks back into the living room and picks up a newspaper. The door
        opens and Kramer enters.

        KRAMER: Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie,
        The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.

        GEORGE: (frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in
        frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.

        George stalks away into the bathroom, and slams the door behind him.


        KRAMER: I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.

        JERRY: I didn't know it was possible not to know that.

        GEORGE (O.C.): (from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?

        KRAMER: (shouting back) Oh, unforgettable.

        GEORGE (O.C.): (disappointed) Oww.

        KRAMER: (nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.

        Kramer opens the door and exits hurriedly.


        [Champagne Video]

        Elaine walks over the 'Vincent' rack, where she finds nothing but copies 
        of a
        video called Betrayed.

        ELAINE: What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...

        Kramer enters the store and hurries over to Elaine.

        KRAMER: Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole 
        coma
        thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.

        ELAINE: Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?

        The store manager comes over and squeezes past Elaine.

        MANAGER: Excuse me.

        The manager removes the 'Vincent' label from the shelf and replaces it 
        with
        another name.

        ELAINE: What're you doing?

        The manager walks back to behind the counter.

        ELAINE: Wha..wha...?

        MANAGER: Vincent stopped making picks.

        ELAINE: (upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?

        MANAGER: We have a wide variety of Gene picks.

        ELAINE: (dismissive) Gene's trash.

        MANAGER: I'm Gene.

        Elaine looks sick at her error. Kramer smiles and raises his eyebrows.

        ELAINE: (forcing a smile) Hi.


        [New York Health & Racquet Club]

        A subdued Milos is behind the counter, before which stands Jerry.

        JERRY: Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about
        your unbelievably bad tennis playing.

        MILOS: (not cheered) Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger
        problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore.

        JERRY: I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.

        MILOS: Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. (hopeful) Wou..would
        you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can 
        show
        her I am still a man.

        JERRY: (reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls 
        around.
        I mean, I wanna be a man too.


        [Monk's]

        Jerry and Elaine sit in a booth.

        JERRY: So you hurt Vincent's feelings?

        ELAINE: (handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.

        JERRY: (taking the envelope) Wh..What's this?

        Jerry opens the envelope and shakes a small object out onto his palm.

        ELAINE: It's the play button, off his VCR.

        JERRY: (examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like 
        a
        tooth.

        George enters and strolls over to the booth.

        GEORGE: (sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working
        for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.

        ELAINE: Ohio? 

        GEORGE: Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.

        JERRY: (nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?

        GEORGE: Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect
        as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.

        ELAINE: See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, 
        is
        all.

        GEORGE: (adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will
        appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead
        mass audience!

        George realises that everyone in the coffee shop is staring over at him, 
        and
        has heard his shouts.

        GEORGE: (waving apologetically) Not you.


        [Elaine's Apartment]

        Elaine is again sitting up in bed, watching a video. (My guess is it's 
        The
        Pain And The Yearning.) The soundtrack can be heard.

        OLD WOMAN (O.C.): Oh, brittle bones. How I long to be rid of the pain.

        The phone rings and Elaine picks up.

        ELAINE: Hello.

        VINCENT (O.C.): Elaine? It's Vincent.

        ELAINE: (surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet 
        you.

        VINCENT (O.C.): No. I can't bear to have anyone see me.

        ELAINE: Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does.
        You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's
        have a look at you.

        VINCENT (O.C.): (relenting) Alright, but, can you bring me few things 
        from
        the store? I haven't been out in a while.


        [Kramer's Car]

        Kramer drives along the street, very slowly. He's got traffic stacked 
        up
        behind him and horns blare as cars manoeuvre around him. Kramer is hunched
        over the steering wheel, looking nervous.

        KRAMER: (indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch 
        of
        crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.


        [Lawyer's Office]

        Kramer stands expectantly in the office. A secretary enters.

        SECRETARY: Hi, can I help you?

        KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to 
        annul
        my living will.

        SECRETARY: Oh. (looks at her watch) Mr Kramer, you had a ten-thirty
        appointment. It's two o'clock. Mr Shellbach had a tennis lesson. He's 
        gone
        for the day.

        Kramer looks anxious again.


        [Tennis Club]

        Jerry and Milos are playing at the other tennis club. They are watched 
        by a
        small number of people, including Patty. Milos delivers a weak underarm
        serve, and Jerry makes no effort to return it, merely wafting his racquet
        vaguely in the direction of the ball.

        JERRY: Too good.

        MILOS: (triumphant shout) Another game for Milos!! Hahaha!


        Milos walks to the net to meet Jerry.

        JERRY: You're on fire today.

        MILOS: (shouting over) Hey Patty. look at this guy. He's awful!

        Patty blows Milos a kiss.

        MILOS: (milking it) He's not a man, this Jerry. He's not even married 
        like I
        am. (laughs) Huhuhuhu.

        JERRY: (quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could
        you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?

        MILOS: (shouting) Hey everybody, look! The little chicken girl wants me 
        to
        ease up. He can't handle this, so he cries like a woman! (laughs evilly)
        Hahaha!

        Milos strides away to continue the game, leaving Jerry looking rueful.


        [Outside Vincent's Apartment]

        Elaine walks down a hallway, carrying a large grocery bag. She reads numbers
        off doors until she spots the one she wants. She gives a smile, flicks 
        her
        hair a little, and knocks at the door.

        ELAINE: Hello? Vincent?

        The door cracks open a few inches, but it's completely dark inside, so 
        the
        occupant can't be seen.

        VINCENT: Elaine?

        ELAINE: I got what you asked.

        VINCENT: Just, leave it and go.

        ELAINE: W..well, can't I come in?

        VINCENT: No. Go away. Now.

        ELAINE: (pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) 
        I
        just, I know you feel what I feel.

        A woman comes up behind Elaine.

        WOMAN: Excuse me. Can I help you?

        VINCENT: Aw, dammit!

        ELAINE: (confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.

        WOMAN: Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?

        The woman pushes the door wide open, revealing Vincent standing there.
        Vincent is a bespectacled, geeky, teen in a plaid shirt. He throws his 
        hands
        up to cover his face.

        VINCENT: (shrieks) No, my acne!

        Vincent darts away from the door into the apartment. Elaine is open-mouthed
        in surprise.

        ELAINE: Ahh-cnee.

        WOMAN: (regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?

        Vincent's mother grabs the top of the bag and begins to rummage through 
        the
        contents.

        WOMAN: (disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind 
        of a
        sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?

        ELAINE: (sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.

        WOMAN: Did he send you part of our VCR?

        Elaine smiles and nods, and pulls at a chain she has round her neck. Threaded
        onto the chain is the VCR button Vincent sent her.

        ELAINE: Yeah.

        Vincent's mother holds out her hand, and Elaine pulls the chain over her 
        head
        and hands it over.

        WOMAN: (entering the apartment) Vincent!

        Elaine reaches into the grocery bag and extracts the bottle of vodka. 
        She
        drops the rest of the bag on the floor, and strolls away, swinging the 
        bottle
        like a club.


        [Tennis Club]

        Jerry and Milos are still playing. Jerry is still throwing the game, and
        Milos is still milking it. Jerry puts an easy return straight into the 
        court
        in front of himself.

        MILOS: (pointing and shouting) Look at the big baby! (laughter) Hehaha. 
        (to
        Jerry) Hey, big baby, are you wetting yourself? Maybe it is time for you 
        to
        be changed. (laughter) Hahah.

        Patty laughs too, with the few other spectators. Jerry looks angry at 
        this
        constant derision.

        JERRY: (quietly) I told you to cut it out.

        Jerry delivers a fierce serve which beats Milos, and almost hits him in 
        the
        face.

        MILOS: (quietly, to Jerry) Hey, c'mon, what're you doing? (to his audience)
        Huhuh. The baby got lucky on that one! Hahah.

        Jerry walks back to deliver another serve. Kramer enters and looks around 
        for
        someone. On another court, Shellbach is facing an automatic serving machine.

        KRAMER: (waving) Shellbach.

        Shellbach waves vaguely back to Kramer, who has begun to walk round the 
        room
        to get to him.

        Meanwhile, Jerry returns a shot to Milos, with some venom. Milos stretches
        desperately to try and reach it, but loses his grip on his racquet. The
        racquet arcs across the hall, watched by Patty, and then spotted by Kramer.

        KRAMER: Racquet.

        The racquet plummets from the air and strikes the guy who is operating 
        the
        automatic serving machine for Shellbach. The guy is knocked unconscious 
        and,
        as he falls, he pushes against the machine, turning it to point at Kramer.
        Kramer stands transfixed, as it continues to launch balls at him. Several
        balls in rapid succession strike him in the head, until he slumps,
        unconscious, to the floor.

        Aeroplane landing, with a caption 'AKRON, OHIO'.


        [Firestone Boardroom, Akron]

        A boardroom very much like that of the Yankees, but with a Firestone sign 
        on
        the wall. Several people sit around the table, including Reilly, and George,
        who is filling his face from a large dish of shrimp.

        REILLY: So, George. You're proposing a snow tyre day at Yankee Stadium?

        GEORGE: (through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field.
        (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought
        enough for everybody.

        MCADAM: (doubtful) I have to say this, this proposal doesn't make a whole 
        lot
        of sense.

        GEORGE: Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many 
        I can
        fit in my mouth.

        George begins picking up shrimp one by one and stuffing them into his 
        mouth.

        REILLY: (leaning forward) You know, George...

        George looks up, expectantly.

        REILLY: The ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.

        Everyone around the table laughs. Except for George, who looks triumphant. 
        He
        swallows, and uses a napkin to clean his fingers.


        GEORGE: (standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called.
        They're running outta you

        REILLY: (unperturbed) What's the difference? You're their all-time best
        seller!

        Reilly and everyone else laughs even more than they did before. George 
        looks
        angry and frustrated, even on the verge of tears for a second, then something
        occurs to him.

        GEORGE: Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.

        George looks round, smiling arrogantly, expecting laughter. But there 
        is a
        deep, uncomfortable, silence. Reilly, looks stony-faced. McAdam stands 
        and
        leans over to speak in George's ear.

        MCADAM: His wife is in a coma.

        George looks sick.


        [Hospital Room]

        Kramer lies in bed, asleep. Jerry sits in a chair, reading a newspaper.
        There's a knock at the door and Elaine enters, carrying a VCR.

        ELAINE: (to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?

        JERRY: He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.

        ELAINE: Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. 
        I got
        him a Gene pick.

        JERRY: What happened to Vincent?

        ELAINE: (evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?

        Jerry points to the wall beside Kramer's bed.

        ELAINE: Ah.

        Elaine walks over and sees both sockets are full. She takes hold of one 
        of
        the plugs and yanks it out of the socket with a grunt. The grunt wakes
        Kramer, who looks groggily around and sees Elaine standing holding the 
        plug,
        as if she's just unplugged his life support. He stares, bug-eyed and shrieks
        in terror.

        KRAMER: (screaming) Waahhh!!!


        [Insert]

        A plane landing, with the caption 'NEW YORK, NEW YORK'.


        [George's Car]

        Once again, George drives along, frustrated and angry.

        GEORGE: 'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called
        and...

        He tails off, as he can't think of anywhere to go. Then a look of
        enlightenment comes to George's face, as he thinks of something.

        GEORGE: (shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration)
        D'ohh!

        George looks gutted for a second, then a determined expression comes to 
        his
        face. He swings the car round with a squeal of tires, and heads back towards
        the airport.

        GEORGE: (cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just
        screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!

        Jerry and Elaine sit side by side on a subway train. They're both reading
        newspapers, when something occurs to Jerry.

        JERRY: You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession
        stand?

        ELAINE: Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the
        banjo?

        JERRY: He's wailing on that banjo.

        ELAINE: Yeah.

        JERRY: I just don't understand the raisinettes.

        ELAINE: The sax player?

        JERRY: Yeah.

        ELAINE: Yeah.

        JERRY: The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another
        box of raisinettes.

        ELAINE: So?

        JERRY: Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.

        ELAINE: HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.

        JERRY: Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.

        ELAINE: He's a musician.

        JERRY: Musicians. Get a real job.

        They shrug and return to their reading.


        [Monk's]

        George is sitting at the counter perusing a magazine. The waitress comes 
        over
        to take his order.

        WAITRESS: What d'you want?

        GEORGE: Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.

        The waitress disappears out back. George goes back to reading. Behind 
        him, a
        beautiful woman enters, and approaches him.

        DANIELLE: (to George) Neil.

        The woman touches George on his shoulder, to get his attention.

        DANIELLE: Neil.

        George turns to face the woman.

        DANIELLE: (apologetic) Oh, I am sorry. (smiling broadly) I'm supposed 
        to meet
        my boyfriend here. He looks just like you.

        GEORGE: (bemused) Really?

        DANIELLE: (smiling) Yeah.

        GEORGE: (pointing to himself) Like me?

        DANIELLE: Uh-huh. Sorry.

        Danielle walks away with a wave. George sits there, looking stunned.

        GEORGE: (confused, to himself) Like me? But how?

        The waitress returns from the back and puts a plate down on the counter
        before George.

        WAITRESS: Here's your halibut omelette. Surprised?

        GEORGE: Yes, yes, I am.


        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry has a suitcase on the table, packing for a trip. Kramer has brought 
        in
        a large paper bag, from which he pulls a blue t-shirt.

        KRAMER: Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was
        closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.

        Kramer holds the shirt up against Jerry and admires it. On the front of 
        the
        shirt is the legend '#1 DAD'.

        KRAMER: Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.

        JERRY: (reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.

        KRAMER: Yeah.

        JERRY: (examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.

        George enters.

        KRAMER: Hey.

        GEORGE: Hey.

        JERRY: Hey.

        GEORGE: Hey. You ready?

        JERRY: Almost.

        KRAMER: Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop 
        off
        some Cubans for me at your parents' house?

        JERRY: (reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new 
        condo.
        I'm gonna be busy.

        KRAMER: Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.

        JERRY: (grudging) Alright.

        KRAMER: Yeahh. I owe you one.

        JERRY: (holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.

        Kramer leaves. George has got himself a bottle of water from the fridge 
        and
        wanders into the living room, talking.

        GEORGE: Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful
        girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.


        JERRY: (continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.

        GEORGE: (incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out)
        This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?

        JERRY: Maybe he has money.

        GEORGE: (wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same,
        except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.

        JERRY: (zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.

        GEORGE: Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. 
        Or
        wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.

        JERRY: (picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?

        Jerry opens the door as George looks at him.

        GEORGE: (pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.

        George leaves, followed by Jerry.


        [Outside Movie Theatre]

        Elaine and her latest boyfriend are standing in line.

        BLAINE: So, what d'you wanna see?

        ELAINE: (indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?

        BLAINE: (indicating another poster) How about The English Patient? It's 
        up
        for all those Oscars.

        Elaine pulls a face, like she's really not interested in seeing Blaine's
        choice.

        ELAINE: Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.

        BLAINE: It's a family in a brown paper bag.

        ELAINE: (laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?

        BLAINE: No.

        Elaine and Blaine reach the front of the queue, just as the guy in the 
        ticket
        booth puts a sign up on the window saying 'Sack Lunch Sold Out'.

        ELAINE: (disappointment) Aww. Sold out.

        BLAINE: (to the booth guy) Oh, two for The English Patient.

        Elaine continues to study the Sack Lunch poster, while Blaine buys tickets.

        ELAINE: So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?


        [Monk's]

        Danielle, the beautiful woman, is paying at the register. George enters 
        and
        sees her.

        GEORGE: (smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like
        Neil?

        DANIELLE: (smiling back) Hi.

        GEORGE: Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?

        DANIELLE: Oh, no. He got held up at work.

        GEORGE: Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how 
        we look
        so similar.

        DANIELLE: Well, you know, you don't look that much like him.

        GEORGE: (disappointment) Oh. Course not.

        DANIELLE: No, you're a little taller.

        George looks ever more bewildered.

        DANIELLE: You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work 
        out?

        GEORGE: (smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...

        Danielle looks like she thinks George is hitting on her, and she's not
        against the idea.

        GEORGE: ...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone
        number?

        Now it's Danielle's time to look surprised and bewildered.


        [Outside Movie Theatre]

        Elaine and Blaine emerge from the exit, having seen The English Patient.

        ELAINE: (very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English
        Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!

        BLAINE: I kinda liked it.

        ELAINE: (firm) No you didn't.

        From the exit emerge several of Elaine's friends, who hurry over to see 
        her.
        They're all holding tissues.

        CAROL: Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?

        GAIL: (tearful) Didn't you love it?

        LISA: How could you not love that movie?

        ELAINE: How about, it sucked?

        CAROL: That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him.

        ELAINE: (aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.

        Blaine gives Elaine a strange look.


        [Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista]

        Jerry and Morty walk into a room which contains some fitness equipment 
        -
        exercise bike, weights, etc.

        MORTY: Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They 
        got
        medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.

        JERRY: Stairmaster?

        MORTY: What?

        JERRY: Nothin'.

        MORTY: (opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?

        Morty has on the '#1 DAD' shirt.

        JERRY: Oh, did you get that outta my bag?

        MORTY: No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and
        thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.

        JERRY: You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.

        In through the door comes a really old guy. He jogs slowly in, and begins
        doing physical jerks as Morty talks to Jerry.

        MORTY: Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy
        Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch
        this.

        Izzy picks up a set of weights and lifts them chest high.

        MORTY: See that? You couldn't do that.

        JERRY: I could, but I choose not to.

        Another guy enters behind the Seinfelds. He walks over to an exercise 
        bike
        and climbs aboard.

        SID: Hey Morty. (nodding toward Jerry) Who's this?

        MORTY: This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks 
        he
        can lift more than Izzy.

        JERRY: (protesting) I..I didn't say that.

        SID: (calling over) Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you 
        can.

        Izzy looks over. He releases his grip on the weights and they drop to 
        the
        floor with a clunk.

        IZZY: Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.

        JERRY: (smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.

        SID: That's not so funny.

        IZZY: (challenging) Think you're better than me, huh?


        MORTY: Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.

        JERRY: (jocular) Eighteen-fifties?

        IZZY: Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down)
        Let's see you lift that.

        JERRY: (reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...

        IZZY: C'mon, c'mon. Pump it!

        JERRY: (consenting) Alright.

        IZZY: Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.

        Jerry walks over and picks the weights up easily.

        JERRY: There. Alright?

        IZZY: Step aside, stringbean.

        Jerry puts down the weights, and rolls them out of the way. Izzy steps 
        in
        front of a much, much, more substantial set of weights.

        IZZY: I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.

        Izzy bends and takes hold of the bar. The second he puts any effort into 
        the
        lift, there is a loud crunching noise and a pained look of horror comes 
        to
        his face.

        IZZY: (agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh.

        Izzy keeps hold of the bar as he slowly keels over forwards. The circular
        weights roll in front of him and Izzy gently falls forward until he's 
        face
        down on the floor.

        IZZY: (drawn out) Aaaahh.

        Jerry, Morty and Sid, look on, concerned.

        SID: Somebody, call an ambulance.

        MORTY: (unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman.
        There's room for one more.


        [Outside Movie Theatre]

        Elaine is at the same movie theatre as before,but alone this time. She's
        buying her ticket from the booth.

        ELAINE: (handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the
        ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.

        Elaine turns to enter the theatre, and meets Gail, Carol and Lisa coming 
        out.

        ELAINE: (surprise) Hey, what're you guys doing here?

        LISA: We just saw The English Patient again.

        GAIL: It's even better the second time.

        ELAINE: They make it longer?

        Out of the theatre comes Blaine, carrying an umbrella.

        BLAINE: (to the girls) Got my umbrella.

        ELAINE: (shocked) Blaine!?

        BLAINE: Elaine.

        ELAINE: I thought you were busy tonight.

        BLAINE: (cold) Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can 
        be
        with someone who doesn't like The English Patient.

        ELAINE: It's just a stupid movie.

        BLAINE: (to Carol) That's what I'm talking about.

        CAROL: (taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go.

        BLAINE: (bitter) Enjoy Sack Lunch!

        Blaine walks away with the girls.

        ELAINE: (fierce) I will!


        [Seinfeld Residence, Del Boca Vista]

        Helen is talking to Jerry, with Morty on the couch. Helen and Morty are 
        in
        their nightclothes. Morty has on the '#1 DAD' shirt.

        HELEN: (accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be
        ashamed of yourself.

        JERRY: (defensive) He egged me on.

        HELEN: You should be more mature.

        JERRY: He's eighty!

        MORTY: (standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise.
        Now, goodnight.

        Morty begins to head to the bedroom.

        HELEN: (walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too
        tight.

        MORTY: This shirt will never leave my body.

        Helen follows Morty down the short hallway.

        HELEN: (to Jerry) Goodnight.

        JERRY: (smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.

        There is a knock at the door. Jerry answers it. Outside are three
        Hispanic-looking guys.

        GUILLERMO: Jerry Seinfeld please.

        JERRY: Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got 
        the
        cigars?

        The guys enter.

        GUILLERMO: What cigars?

        JERRY: Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.

        GUILLERMO: (indicating the threesome) We are the Cubans.

        Jerry stares, stunned.


        [Jerry's Apartment/Del Boca Vista]

        Kramer stands, shirtless, in Jerry's kitchen. There's a pot on the stove, 
        and
        Kramer's chopping vegetables on a board. The phone rings and Kramer answers.

        KRAMER: Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.

        In the Seinfelds' condo, the three guys are asleep on the fold-out couch 
        and
        a chair, while an upset Jerry rants into the phone.

        JERRY: (animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!

        KRAMER: I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?

        JERRY: Cigars!

        KRAMER: Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I 
        got
        these guys.

        JERRY: (incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?

        KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.

        Behind Jerry, Morty wanders over to the kitchen counter.

        JERRY: (to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.

        Morty sorts through some pill bottles, before picking one out.

        MORTY: (without looking up) Who are they?

        JERRY: They're Cuban cigar rollers.

        MORTY: (walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.

        Something catches Jerry's ear on the phone.

        JERRY: What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?

        KRAMER: Hot and spicy.

        JERRY: (accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?

        KRAMER: Yes I am.

        JERRY: What colour is it?

        Kramer looks down at his bare torso, and can't think.

        KRAMER: Damn!


        Kramer hangs up the phone.


        [New York Hallway]

        George and Danielle walk up to her door in her building. George has a 
        napkin
        in his hand on which is some scribbled numbers. Danielle is looking at
        George, very much as if she's interested.

        GEORGE: You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't
        have to take me out to dinner.

        DANIELLE: I wanted to give it to you in person.

        George shrugs his understanding.

        DANIELLE: (flirtatious) You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, 
        and I
        know a great breakfast place, right around the corner.

        Danielle gives George a big smile. George smiles, but thoughtfully.

        GEORGE: Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?

        DANIELLE: (inviting) Why don't you come in? We'll take about it.

        GEORGE: (looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I 
        wanna
        be home in case Neil calls.

        DANIELLE: Well, goodnight.

        Danielle leans toward George, for a kiss. But George walks away completely
        oblivious to Danielle.

        GEORGE: (hurried) I'll see you.

        Danielle looks down the hall after George, looking perplexed.


        [Monk's]

        An unhappy Elaine sits at the counter as the waitress pours her coffee.

        WAITRESS: Rough night?

        ELAINE: Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, 
        who
        I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I 
        don't
        like that stupid English Patient movie.

        WAITRESS: Really? I thought it was pretty good.

        ELAINE: Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex 
        scenes!
        I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!

        WAITRESS: (sour) Well, I liked it.

        The waitress takes the coffee pot and walks away into the back.

        ELAINE: (calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello?
        (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!


        [Mandelbaum Residence, Del Boca Vista]

        Jerry and Morty stroll into the bedroom of the hugely impressive Mandelbaum
        condo. Morty is still wearing the '#1 DAD' shirt under his tracksuit. 
        Izzy is
        asleep in the bed.

        JERRY: This is quite a condo.

        MORTY: The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.

        JERRY: The crepe place?

        MORTY: Yeah. This is all big crepe money.

        JERRY: (doubtful) There's crepe money?

        Izzy wakes up and sees the Seinfelds at the foot of his bed.

        IZZY: What are you doing here?

        JERRY: (apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell 
        you
        how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.

        Izzy stares at Morty as Jerry speaks.

        IZZY: What the hell is that?

        JERRY: What?

        IZZY: That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?

        MORTY: This was a gift from my son.

        Morty displays the shirt proudly. Jerry smiles.

        IZZY: Oh, I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta
        commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number
        one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one.

        Izzy starts to move to get out of bed.

        JERRY: Mr Mandelbaum, please.

        IZZY: It's go time.

        Izzy stands up and there is a familiar crunching noise. Izzy freezes in 
        his
        stance, arms raised.

        IZZY: (pained) Ahh. My back. I can't move.

        Jerry and Morty look on with horrified concern.

        MORTY: Call an ambulance.

        JERRY: I think I saw one a coupla doors down.

        Jerry darts out of the door, followed moments later by Morty.


        [Jerry's Apartment/Del Boca Vista]

        Jerry has just returned from Florida, and is putting away his bag. A worried
        George sits at the table.

        JERRY: (disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because 
        you
        thought some guy might be calling you?!

        Jerry puts his bag in the bedroom and returns as George paces the floor.

        GEORGE: (animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how 
        he
        could get a girl like Danielle.

        JERRY: (pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget 
        about
        Neil. You've out-Neiled him.

        GEORGE: (surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?

        JERRY: I don't know, but you better keep it up.

        GEORGE: I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil 
        in
        town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!

        George exits, cheerfully. The phone rings as the door closes.

        JERRY: (to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole
        operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.

        In Florida, Helen and Morty each have a handset. Morty is still wearing 
        the
        '#1 DAD' shirt.

        MORTY: Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back
        specialist?

        JERRY: I will, I just walked in the door.

        HELEN: You have to go see him.

        JERRY: Ma.

        MORTY: Helen, will you stop bothering him.

        HELEN: Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.

        MORTY: Number One, signing off.

        The Seinfelds hang up. Jerry's door opens and Kramer bursts in, agitated.

        KRAMER: Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill)
        What's going on!?

        JERRY: What?

        KRAMER: (animated) They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.

        JERRY: So?

        KRAMER: So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's 
        off.

        JERRY: What's the difference?

        KRAMER: Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else 
        like
        it.


        JERRY: (confused) We're talking about people, right?

        KRAMER: Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These
        guys don't have it.

        JERRY: I thought they smelled pretty nice.

        KRAMER: Jerry, your palate's unrefined.

        JERRY: Is not.

        KRAMER: Is too.

        JERRY: Is not.

        KRAMER: Is too.

        JERRY: I'm not having this conversation.

        KRAMER: Are too.

        JERRY: Am not.

        KRAMER: Are too.

        JERRY: Am not.

        KRAMER: Are too.


        [J Peterman's Office]

        Peterman lounges behind his desk, as Elaine and another employee pick 
        up
        notes, photographs, etc.

        PETERMAN: Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient
        film last night. It was extraordinary.

        DUGAN: (enthusiastic) Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me.

        Dugan walks away.

        PETERMAN: Elaine, what'd you think?

        ELAINE: (hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't
        tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.

        PETERMAN: (aghast) You haven't seen it?

        ELAINE: (shakes head) No.

        PETERMAN: That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.

        Peterman stuffs some paperwork into a desk drawer.


        [The New York Hospital]

        Izzy is in a hospital bed, as Jerry stands beside it.

        JERRY: Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the 
        best.
        So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try 
        and
        find my number.

        Jerry turns to walk out.

        IZZY: Uh, oh, wait.

        Izzy rummages on his bedside table and picks up a t-shirt. He holds it 
        up to
        his chest so Jerry can read what's written on it. 'World's Greatest DAD!'

        IZZY: How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for 
        me.

        JERRY: (humouring him) That's very nice.

        IZZY: The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better
        than just number one.

        JERRY: Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.

        Behind Jerry, an elderly bald guy leans round the doorframe and raps on 
        the
        door, attracting Izzy's attention.

        IZZY: Hi, son.

        IZZY JR.: Hi daddy.

        JERRY: (surprise) This is your son?

        IZZY: I got married in high school.

        IZZY JR.: (to Jerry) Hey, who are you?

        IZZY: This is Seinfeld's kid.

        IZZY JR.: Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man? (squaring 
        up to
        Jerry) Maybe you'd like to try taking on somebody your own age.

        JERRY: (jocular) You got any kids?

        IZZY JR.: Oh, you think you're better than me? (challenging) Go ahead, 
        pick
        out anything in the room here. I'll lift it up over my head.

        JERRY: (trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.

        IZZY: (pointing) The television.

        JERRY: (under his breath) Oh no.

        Izzy Jr walks over to the TV, which sits on top of a cabinet.

        IZZY JR.: This one's for you, Pop. It's go time.

        Izzy Jr takes a grip on the TV, but there's another crunching sound as 
        he
        tries to lift, and an agonised expression comes to his face. Jerry cringes 
        in
        the background.

        IZZY JR.: (pained) Ohh! My back!

        IZZY: (urgent) Call an ambulance.

        JERRY: (laconic) We're already in a hospital.


        [Earl Haffler's Office]

        A suit-wearing Kramer is in the office of Earl Haffler - cigar-smoking,
        stetson-wearing, Texan businessman.

        HAFFLER: Awright, partner. Let's get down to business.

        KRAMER: (nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.

        Kramer walks over to the door trying to smile confidently.

        KRAMER: They're right out here.

        Kramer calls a few words of nonsense Spanish out of the door, and the 
        three
        guys stroll in. They are dressed in Castro-style green fatigues and caps.

        KRAMER: Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.

        Earl Haffler regards the three for a second or two.

        HAFFLER: You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in 
        a
        Cuban wrapper now, would you?

        KRAMER: (fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any 
        more
        Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.

        HAFFLER: (confusion) We're talking about people, right?

        KRAMER: (puzzled) I think so.

        HAFFLER: I thought he quit smoking cigars.

        KRAMER: Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks 
        for
        a second) ...Dennis.

        HAFFLER: (dubious) Dennis Castro?

        KRAMER: Uh, Dwayne.

        HAFFLER: Get the hell outta my office.

        KRAMER: (shrill) What!?


        [Monk's]

        Danielle and George walk over to, and sit in, a booth.

        DANIELLE: You know, Neil called me today.

        GEORGE: (interested) Really?

        DANIELLE: Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with
        you.

        GEORGE: (smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.

        DANIELLE: He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.

        GEORGE: (little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with 
        me.


        DANIELLE: (surprised) What?

        GEORGE: (smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee.

        Danielle smiles at George, still a touch confused.


        [Movie Theatre]

        Peterman and Elaine sit in the auditorium. The English Patient is playing 
        and
        many of the crowd are tearfully dabbing their eyes. Peterman is particularly
        emotional. Elaine looks completely bored, and is tossing pieces of popcorn 
        up
        in the air to try and catch them in her mouth.

        PETERMAN: (emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.

        One of Elaine's bits of popcorn misses her mouth and falls behind her 
        seat.
        Elaine twists round and reaches over to retrieve it, before slumping in 
        her
        seat wearily.

        ELAINE: (indifferent) Yuh.


        [Monk's]

        Jerry and George sit in a booth. George looks ragged and is swigging from 
        a
        bottle of some anti-acid medication.

        JERRY: (incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?

        GEORGE: I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.

        JERRY: (musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?

        George thinks for a moment, his eyes twitching.

        GEORGE: (animated) Then I'm going to Mars!

        JERRY: What if it's Neil Diamond?

        GEORGE: (tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!

        JERRY: Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.

        GEORGE: What, to see the old guy?

        JERRY: No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.

        GEORGE: How old's the son?

        JERRY: I think he's the same age as the father.

        GEORGE: What is with this family?

        JERRY: I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to 
        bench
        press the casket.

        Kramer sidles into the coffee shop. He peers past the register, to where 
        the
        three guys are sitting in the far corner, talking together. Then he moves
        over to join Jerry and George.

        KRAMER: (quietly) Hey, Jerry.

        Kramer indicates the three guys with his thumb.

        KRAMER: (noise - like shivery) Datiditadit.

        JERRY: You're cold?

        KRAMER: No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.

        JERRY: Something wrong with your chest?

        KRAMER: (indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There.

        JERRY: (leaning round Kramer) Where?

        KRAMER: (urgent) No, no. Don't look. Don't look.

        Jerry and George look as if they're infected by Kramer's nervousness, 
        as they
        try and look surreptitiously at the Dominicans.

        KRAMER: Over there. The Dominicans.

        JERRY: Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?

        KRAMER: Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them 
        to
        do.

        GEORGE: So?

        KRAMER: So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You
        know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.

        In the corner, one of the Dominicans thumps the table, as if to underscore 
        a
        point in his argument.

        JERRY: Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.

        KRAMER: (nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and 
        the
        people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself,
        shrill) El Presidente!

        Again, one of the Dominicans thumps the table. Kramer jumps at the sound.


        [The New York Hospital]

        Izzy and Izzy Jr are laid up in beds placed side-by-side.

        JERRY: I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.

        IZZY JR.: I bet you pulled that trick on my daddy, in Florida.

        JERRY: He couldn't handle the weight.

        IZZY: (hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?

        IZZY JR.: (indicating Izzy) You think you're better than him?!

        JERRY: (placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're
        both better than me.

        IZZY: Okay.

        An even more elderly guy than Izzy enters the room behind Jerry. He spreads
        his arms in greeting to the Mandelbaums.

        IZZY SR.: My boys.

        IZZY: My dad.

        IZZY JR.: My grandpa.

        JERRY: (incredulous) Oh, come on!

        IZZY SR.: (indicating Izzy Jr) What happened to him?

        JERRY: He was trying to lift the TV.

        IZZY SR.: (pointing) That TV?

        Izzy Sr. strides purposefully toward the TV.

        JERRY: (consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.

        Off-screen there is a familiar crunching sound

        IZZY IZZY SR.. (O.C.): (pained) Oohh!


        [The New York Hospital]

        All three of the Mandelbaums are in a row of beds in the same room.

        IZZY SR.: Why didn't anybody tell me? It was bolted down!

        IZZY: I still thought you could do it.

        IZZY JR.: Me too.

        IZZY/IZZY JR/IZZY IZZY SR.: (chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum,
        Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...

        JERRY: Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.

        IZZY: Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've
        ruined our business with all your macho head games.

        JERRY: (defensive) I didn't ruin your business.

        IZZY: Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll 
        the
        crepes. We gotta close it up.

        JERRY: (uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?

        IZZY: Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts 
        the
        magic in Magic Pan!

        JERRY: (thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?

        IZZY: Yeah.

        JERRY: (having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.

        Jerry turns and starts to leave, but is called back.


        IZZY SR.: (calls) Hey, I can't see the TV.

        Jerry walks to the TV and picks it,and the attached cabinet up. HE carries 
        it
        across the room to the foot of Izzy Sr.'s bed,where he places it.

        JERRY: Here.

        Jerry walks out of the room followed by the angry cries of Izzy.

        IZZY: You think you're better than us,don't you?! Huh!?


        [Movie Theatre]

        Peterman and Elaine are still in front of The English Patient. Peterman
        stares, enraptured, at the screen. Elaine is totally frantic with boredom.

        PETERMAN: Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't 
        take my
        eyes off the passion.

        ELAINE: (quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's 
        too
        long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid
        desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!

        The other movie patrons turn and shush Elaine, who sits back in her seat.

        PETERMAN: (surprised) Elaine. You don't like the movie?

        ELAINE: (shouts) I hate it!!

        CROWD: Shh!

        ELAINE: (shouts) Oh, go to hell!!

        PETERMAN: (quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're
        fired.

        ELAINE: (grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.

        Elaine hurriedly gets out of her seat and leaves.


        [Magic Pan Restaurant]

        Jerry and Elaine sit in a booth, talking over coffee.

        JERRY: He was gonna fire you?

        ELAINE: The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go 
        and
        visit the Tunisian desert.

        JERRY: Tunisia?

        ELAINE: That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.

        JERRY: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

        ELAINE: I have to live in a cave.

        JERRY: (sardonic) Oh. (smiles)

        Kramer comes over to the booth.

        KRAMER: These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at 
        that.
        It's like they're rolling a double corona.

        The three Dominican guys are making crepes, and then rolling them around
        fillings.

        KRAMER: (to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?

        The Dominican smiles back.

        Over in another part of the restaurant, Danielle sits in a booth with 
        Neil.
        Neil is clearly bald, but has his back to the camera.

        DANIELLE: I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.

        Neil's head drops at this news.

        DANIELLE: Come on, let's just eat our crepes.

        The Dominicans are handing out plates of rolled crepes to various tables.

        At one table a customer prods a rolled crepe with his fork and a jet of
        scalding hot filling squirts out into his face.

        CUSTOMER: (pained scream) Aaghh!! My face!

        At another table, another customer digs his fork in, and is rewarded with 
        a
        faceful of blistering filling.

        Neil sticks his fork into his crepe and recoils as hot liquid jets into 
        his
        face.

        DANIELLE: (concerned cry) Neil!

        The restaurant is in chaos as yells of pain come from all sides. Elaine,
        Jerry and Kramer look round at the commotion.

        JERRY: Why are the crepes spraying?

        KRAMER: (looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them 
        too
        tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.

        Another scream rents the air.


        [Metropolitan Hospital Center]

        In a hospital room, Neil lies in a bed, his face obscured with bandages 
        and
        an IV line connected to him. Danielle is there fussing with the remains 
        of a
        hospital meal on a tray. George enters.

        GEORGE: Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?

        DANIELLE: Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.

        George picks up a walking stick which was propped against the bed.

        GEORGE: (to Danielle) Whose cane is this?

        DANIELLE: It's Neil's.

        Danielle walks away with a water jug from Neil's table. She goes to a 
        sink in
        the corner as George speaks.

        GEORGE: (to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. 
        I
        admire your skills, Mr Peanut.

        Danielle brings back the jug.

        GEORGE: Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got 
        a key
        made for you.

        George flourishes a doorkey before Danielle.

        DANIELLE: George, I can't move in with you.

        GEORGE: (shocked) What?

        DANIELLE: I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.

        GEORGE: (animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! 
        I'll
        burn myself. I'll burn my parents!

        DANIELLE: Sorry George.

        Danielle takes the jug and leaves the room. Dejectedly, George wanders 
        toward
        the door. As he moves, Neil whispers to him.

        NEIL: (beckoning) George.

        George leans over to Neil, so he can hear him speak.

        NEIL: (quiet triumph) I win.

        George purses his lips and nods ruefully. He stands up and leaves, closing
        the door behind him. There is a brief pause, then the door opens a few 
        inches
        and George's hand reaches back inside the room, takes hold of the IV line 
        and
        tugs it sharply, breaking it free of the IV bag,and drops it. Then the 
        hand
        is withdrawn and the door closes again.


        [Plane]

        Elaine sits in an aisle seat in a 747, reading a Let's Go Tunisia book. 
        She
        listens as a voice comes over the tannoy.

        TAN: Ladies and gentlemen. In just one moment, we'll be showing our feature
        presentation...

        ELAINE: (dread) No, no, no, no, no.

        TAN: ...the comedy hit, Sack Lunch, starring Dabney Coleman.

        ELAINE: (cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.

        Smiling, Elaine puts down her book to watch the movie. Someone from a 

        seat
        beside her wants to get out.

        GUY: Excuse me, please.

        ELAINE: Oh, sure.

        The guy pushes past her. He's holding a rolled-up magazine closely to 
        his
        body, as if concealing something and, strangely, is wearing a '#1 DAD'
        t-shirt. There's a little awkwardness as he squeezes by.

        ELAINE: (uncomfortable) Ooh.

        The guy walks down the aisle and turns to face the passengers. Two other 
        guys
        in '#1 DAD' t-shirts flank him. They are the three Dominican guys.

        GUILLERMO: Ladies and gentlemen. Because we have been exploited by your 
        Magic
        Pan crepe restaurants...

        From inside his magazine, Guillermo produces a revolver. The other two 
        guys
        also pull out guns, which they point upwards and cock, loudly.

        GUILLERMO: ...we are hijacking this plane to Cuba!

        There is consternation among the passengers, shocked looks, gasps, etc.

        GUILLERMO: Everyone stay in your seats. And shut that movie off!

        ELAINE: (annoyed) Aww, nuts!


        [Putumayo]

        Inside a store full of ethnic merchandise. Elaine is examining some sort 
        of footwear, while behind the counter Gladys is on the phone.

        ELAINE: Uh, excuse me.

        GLADYS: Be with you in a minute. (turns her back to Elaine and continues 
        into
        phone) No, you shoulda come last night, it was fun.

        ELAINE: Uhm, I just have a question.

        GLADYS: (into phone) I know, the margaritas in that place are so strong.

        ELAINE: (walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.

        GLADYS: (into phone) So? What else is goin' on?

        ELAINE: (shouts) HEY!!

        GLADYS: Listen, I'll call you back. (to Elaine) Yes? What can I do for 
        you?

        ELAINE: (tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost 
        a
        customer.

        Elaine stalks to the door, but ruins her exit by trying to push open a 
        door she
        should pull.

        [Valerie's Apartment]

        Jerry, pulling on his jacket, and Valerie preparing to leave.

        VALERIE: Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the previews.

        JERRY: Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre 
        cut
        up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.

        VALERIE: I think that I was in that theatre. That, that was really funny.

        JERRY: Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before 
        we go.

        Valerie heads toward the door. Jerry sits by the phone, lifts the receiver 
        and
        prepares to dial. As he does so, he notices button '07' on the speed-dial 
        is
        marked 'JERRY'. He looks surprised and pleased together.

        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry and George stood talking.

        GEORGE: So you're on the speed dial?

        JERRY: After two dates!

        GEORGE: What number?

        JERRY: Seven.

        GEORGE: Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that
        plastic thing with a pen.

        The door opens and Kramer enters. He's carrying a couple of folding chairs 
        in
        each hand.

        KRAMER: Uh, hey buddy.

        JERRY: Hey.

        Kramer carries the chairs across the room.

        KRAMER: It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New 
        Year's Eve
        party.

        JERRY: You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!

        Kramer props the chairs up against a wall.

        KRAMER: No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. 
        I told
        you about that.

        JERRY: Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half 
        years?!

        KRAMER: You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna 
        keep
        in front of 'em.

        Kramer exits. George has taken one of the chairs, unfolded it, and is 
        sat with
        his feet up on the back of the couch, hands behind his head.

        GEORGE: Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets 
        front
        office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.

        JERRY: What for?

        GEORGE: (smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna 
        pick my
        brains.

        JERRY: Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?

        GEORGE: (thoughtful) I have no idea.

        Elaine enters, throws her bag on the table. She's in a bad mood.

        ELAINE: Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.

        JERRY: I don't mind the Mayans.

        Elaine gets another of the folding chairs.

        ELAINE: (unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was 
        trying to
        buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored 
        me.

        Kramer enters carrying more chairs.

        KRAMER: What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.

        ELAINE: No, no, not Putumayo.

        KRAMER: No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me 
        on to
        it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.

        GEORGE: (slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous 
        about
        this lunch.

        ELAINE: What'd you have?

        Kramer enters again. This time he has a large bunch of multi-coloured 
        balloons
        on ribbons. He ties the bunch to Elaine's chair.

        KRAMER: Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. 
        (begins to
        leave)

        JERRY: Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!

        KRAMER: (at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my 
        everyday
        balloons.

        [Monk's]


        George sits in a booth. Opposite him are two guys from the Mets.

        MINKLER: George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting, 
        and
        we think that someone might be you.

        GEORGE: (surprise) Head of scouting?

        MOONEY: Interested?

        GEORGE: (playing it cool) I'm still here.

        MINKLER: Now, unfortunately, league rules prevent us from making you an 
        offer
        while you're still under contract.

        MOONEY: You understand what we're talking about?

        GEORGE: So you're talking...

        MINKLER: No, no.

        MOONEY: We're *not* talking. We're just, talking.

        GEORGE: So, you need me to get fired.

        MINKLER: We didn't say that.

        MOONEY: We couldn't say that, because even if we did...

        MINKLER: ...we couldn't say that we said it.

        MOONEY: You see what we're saying?

        GEORGE: (jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?

        MINKLER: (serious) We didn't say that.

        [Valerie's Apartment]

        Valerie is sitting by her phone, having just finished some adjustment. 
        Jerry
        arrives, obviously a little rushed.

        JERRY: Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment.
        How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?

        VALERIE: (pointedly) Someplace nice this time?

        JERRY: Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard 
        good
        things.

        VALERIE: (rising) I don't know, got a two in Zagat's.

        Valerie rises and leaves the room. As she goes, Jerry sits beside the 
        phone.

        JERRY: Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.

        Jerry presses the '07' button, without looking.

        VOICE (O.C.): Hello?

        JERRY: Hello? Who's this?

        VOICE (O.C.): Jane. What number did you dial?

        He looks down at the speed-dial and sees button '07' now marked 'JANE', 
        and his
        name now next to '09'.

        JERRY: Seven?

        [Putumayo]

        Gladys is behind the counter. Through the window, Elaine can be seen outside.
        Elaine bangs on the window to get Gladys' attention.

        ELAINE: Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) 
        Cinqo
        de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)

        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry and Kramer sit at the table. Jerry reading a newspaper, Kramer with 
        a
        clipboard. George is heard outside the door.

        GEORGE (O.C.): (singing) Meet the Mets...

        George enters, looking pleased with himself.

        GEORGE: ...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.

        JERRY: Good meeting?

        GEORGE: There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it 
        was quite
        a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The 
        only thing
        is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.

        JERRY: You can do that.

        GEORGE: Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, 
        uh. I
        wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy 
        got
        canned!'

        JERRY: So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?

        GEORGE: Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled 
        my
        feet in the soft-serve machine?

        KRAMER: You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand?
        Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?

        Jerry and George give Kramer a long look. Then break to continue their 
        own
        conversation.

        JERRY: So, George...

        GEORGE: Yeah.

        JERRY: (rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine 
        on the
        speed-dial.

        Jerry moves to the kitchen, with George following.

        GEORGE: So?

        JERRY: So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.

        GEORGE: What, she's ranking you?

        JERRY: Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.

        GEORGE: What is a barometer exactly?

        KRAMER: It's pronounced thermometer.

        Jerry gives another look to Kramer. George raises his eyes. Kramer rises 
        and
        comes over to the guys.

        KRAMER: You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. 
        You'll
        just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, 
        wup
        (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on 
        a 'mental
        phone') getting a call here.

        KRAMER: (to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, 
        how you
        doing, Newman?

        Jerry begins mouthing 'I'm not here' and making gestures indicating he 
        doesn't
        want to talk to Newman.

        KRAMER: (to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?

        Kramer leans toward Jerry, as if to allow him to use the 'mental phone'. 
        Jerry
        throws his arms up in exasperation.

        [Valerie's Apartment]

        Jerry has just arrived and has presented Valerie with a floral bouquet.

        VALERIE: (pleased) Oh, flowers. You didn't have to do that. I mean, the 
        dinner,
        and the play, and the hansom cab ride.

        JERRY: Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate 
        to
        Barnes and Noble.

        VALERIE: Oh.

        JERRY: (resumes) ...you know, make a good impression.

        VALERIE: I'm gonna go put these in some water.

        JERRY: I like the way you think.

        Valerie leaves to the kitchen(?). The moment she's gone, Jerry rushes 
        over to
        the phone. He picks it up to read the list of names on the speed-dial, 
        and finds
        himself promoted to the '01' button.

        JERRY: Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!


        [Yankees Boardroom(?)]

        Wilhelm and some others are sitting around the big table. George is sitting
        down. He's wearing an old-fashioned baseball jersey. On the table in front 
        of
        him, he places a large paper bag.

        GEORGE: Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride
        display case.

        WILHELM: Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?

        GEORGE: Is it? (reaches into bag)

        Wilhelm looks disturbed by George's actions.

        GEORGE: Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. 
        Ooh,
        juicy this time of year.

        He wipes strawberry juice from his fingers onto Babe Ruth's jersey.

        GEORGE: Gotta get the good ones.

        He fetches another over-ripe strawberry from the bag, and drops it onto 
        the
        front of the jersey leaving a pulpy stain.

        GEORGE: Oh, that's bad. That's bad.

        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Kramer sits at the table with his clipboard.

        KRAMER: So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people 
        be
        able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?

        JERRY: Some of us.

        KRAMER: (crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.

        Elaine enters. She is festooned with Mayan goods. All her clothes, bag,
        earrings, everything.

        JERRY: Hola.

        ELAINE: Shove it!

        JERRY: What is all this?

        ELAINE: I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to 
        show
        Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates
        dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.

        JERRY: Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.

        KRAMER: Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.

        ELAINE: Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his 
        party.

        Elaine fishes in her bag for the invite.

        KRAMER: Newman?

        ELAINE: Yeah.

        Elaine hands her invite to Kramer.

        KRAMER: (reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!

        [Jerry's Car]

        Jerry has stopped to pick someone up. A woman climbs into the passenger 
        side.

        JERRY: Hi Valerie.

        The woman turns to face him.

        JERRY: You're not Valerie.

        MRS HAMILTON: I'm her step-mother. Drive.

        Jerry does as he's told and sets off down the street.

        MRS HAMILTON: It's taken me thirteen years to climb up to the top of that
        speed-dial, and I don't intend to lose my spot to you.

        JERRY: But, I never...

        MRS HAMILTON: (threatening) You just stay away from that phone.

        [Steinbrenner's Office]

        Steinbrenner behind his desk. George crosses the floor from the door.

        GEORGE: You wanted to see me, sir?

        STEINBRENNER: I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning...

        George looks quietly pleased at his imminent dismissal.

        GEORGE: Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here 
        in an
        hour.

        STEINBRENNER: ...and I have to tell you, it's exactly what this organisation
        needed.

        George looks stunned as he realises he's not going to be fired.

        STEINBRENNER: We wanna look to the future, we gotta tear down the past. 
        Babe
        Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man, with little-girl legs. And here's
        something I just found out recently. He wasn't really a sultan. Ah, what 
        d'you
        make of that? Hey, check this out. (he stands to reveal he's wearing baseball
        pants) Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit. (a thought occurs) Hey, you 
        don't
        think that nerve disease of his was contagious, do you? Uh, I better take 
        'em
        off. I'm too important to this team. (removes the pants to reveal his 
        boxers)
        Big Stein can't be flopping and twitching.

        George is further discomfited by the sight of Steinbrenner in his underwear.

        STEINBRENNER: Hey, how 'bout some lunch. What're you going for?

        [Valerie's Apartment]

        Jerry and Valerie are sitting on the couch, eating popcorn.

        JERRY: You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on 
        your
        speed-dial.

        VALERIE: You deserve it.

        JERRY: But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life 
        who
        deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.

        VALERIE: My stepmother got to you, didn't she?

        JERRY: What? No.

        VALERIE: Uuh, I can't believe she did this again. That's it! She's off 
        the
        speed-dial completely!

        Valerie gets up, stalks to the phone and sets about rejigging her speed-dial.

        JERRY: Yikes!

        [Newman's Apartment]

        Newman sits at the table. Kramer has arrived and is holding his invitation.

        KRAMER: Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.

        NEWMAN: You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.

        KRAMER: (getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, 
        but you
        just had to throw yours on the same day!

        NEWMAN: I have done nothing unethical.

        KRAMER: Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody
        about my party.

        NEWMAN: Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning 
        this
        in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant
        that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.

        KRAMER: (worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding
        chairs, and quite a bit of ice.

        NEWMAN: (thoughtful) What kind?

        KRAMER: Cubed.

        NEWMAN: That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, 
        I'll
        tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition.
        No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.

        KRAMER: I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.

        NEWMAN: That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year
        two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!

        [Cab]


        Jerry and George in the back of a taxi.

        JERRY: How could they not fire you?

        GEORGE: Never thought I'd fail at failing.

        JERRY: Aw, come on there now.

        GEORGE: (depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.

        JERRY: Nonsense. You do everything wrong.

        GEORGE: (hopeful) Everything?

        JERRY: Everything.

        GEORGE: You really think so?

        JERRY: Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.

        GEORGE: Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, 
        and
        throw myself right back down again!

        JERRY: That's the spirit. You suck!

        GEORGE: (pleased) I know.

        [Cinqo De Mayo]

        Elaine is talking with the saleswoman.

        ELAINE: No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can 
        drive
        Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.

        Gladys comes out behind the counter.

        GLADYS: Do you need some help with something?

        ELAINE: (puzzled) You? What're you doing here?

        GLADYS: I own this store.

        ELAINE: No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs
        nervously)

        GLADYS: I'm Gladys Mayo.

        Realisation dawns for Elaine. She begins to leave, slowly.

        ELAINE: Ah, this really sticks in my craw.

        [Mrs Hamilton's Apartment]

        Jerry and Mrs Hamilton sitting on the couch. Mrs Hamilton is pouring out 
        a
        couple of glasses of wine.

        JERRY: Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched
        things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?

        MRS HAMILTON: I'm sure she'll be along. (handing over a glass) Have some 
        wine,
        Jerome.

        JERRY: Okay.

        Mrs Hamilton leans back on the couch beside Jerry. She's sitting uncomfortably
        close to Jerry, and as she speaks she puts an arm along the top of the 
        couch
        behind Jerry. (To cut it short, this scene plays pretty close to the early
        Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft scenes in The Graduate.)

        MRS HAMILTON: You know Jerome, I can understand what Valerie sees in you. 
        So
        attractive, so strong, so comedic.

        JERRY: Uh, good.

        MRS HAMILTON: Jerome, I have a deliciously naughty idea.

        JERRY: (nervous) What?

        MRS HAMILTON: Why don't I put you on my speed-dial?

        JERRY: I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...

        MRS HAMILTON: Don't be such a child, Jerome. How's number three sound?

        Jerry leaps to his feet as Mrs Hamilton goes for her phone.

        JERRY: Valerie's not coming over, is she?

        Mrs Hamilton is programming her phone.

        MRS HAMILTON: Seven, four...

        JERRY: No...

        MRS HAMILTON: Two...

        JERRY: Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?

        MRS HAMILTON: I won't tell if you don't.

        JERRY: (leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...

        [Kramer's Apartment]

        Kramer is asleep, but his sleep is fitful. He tosses and turns.

        KRAMER: Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...

        Kramer suddenly sits bolt upright.

        KRAMER: (yells) Newmanniun!!

        He reaches over to his bedside table and picks up a photograph. It's of 
        himself
        and Jerry at a previous party, looking happy together.

        KRAMER: (whimper) Jerry?

        Kramer clutches the photo to his chest, and flops back onto the mattress.

        [Jerry's Apartment]

        Jerry sits on his couch, watching baseball on TV. Steve Koren is commentating.

        KOREN (O.C.): Alright, Yankees, two. Orioles, nothing. Wait a minute! 
        A short
        stocky bald man is streaking across the field.

        JERRY: Oh my God, George!

        KOREN (O.C.): Check that. He's not streaking. He's wearing a flesh-tone
        body-stocking. Apparently, he's a bit bashful, and oddly, no-one seems 
        upset.

        Kramer enters.

        JERRY: Kramer, look, it's George.

        KOREN (O.C.): Everyone loves him.

        KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't 
        let
        you come to my New Year's party.

        JERRY: (neutral) Fine.

        KRAMER: (agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the
        invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!

        JERRY: (neutral) No problem.

        KRAMER: (swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without 
        you. I
        feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.

        Elaine enters.

        KRAMER: (pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.

        ELAINE: (neutral) Okay.

        KRAMER: No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with 
        me and
        Jerry.

        ELAINE: (neutral) Fine.

        KRAMER: (frustrated shout) Oh come on!!

        ELAINE: (neutral) Alright.

        KRAMER: (triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, 
        huh.
        (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell 
        Newman I
        don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.

        Kramer heads out the door.

        ELAINE: (following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. 
        Do
        you still have that pricing-gun?

        KRAMER: Yeah.

        ELAINE: Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.

        KRAMER: Can do.

        Kramer leaves to his apartment. Elaine begins to follow.

        JERRY: What're you doing with a pricing-gun?

        ELAINE: That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over

        ninety-nine cents.

        Elaine leaves and shuts the door.

        JERRY: (to himself) Still a rip-off.

        The phone rings. Jerry picks up.

        JERRY: Hello?

        From here on, the scene is presented in a split-screen format, with Valerie 
        and
        Mrs Hamilton in their respective apartments, sharing the screen with Jerry 
        as
        appropriate.

        VALERIE: Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were 
        on her
        speed-dial.

        JERRY: Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs 
        on you.

        There is a beep on Jerry's phone as another call comes in.

        JERRY: Hold on a second.

        Jerry clicks the doofer to answer the other call.

        JERRY: Hello?

        MRS HAMILTON: (seductive) Hi Jerome.

        JERRY: Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on 
        the other
        line. Just a second.

        Jerry clicks.

        JERRY: Hello?

        VALERIE: That's her on the other line, isn't it?

        JERRY: Well...

        VALERIE: Tell her I don't want you on her speed-dial.

        JERRY: Hang on.

        Jerry clicks.

        JERRY: She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me 
        off this
        thing.

        MRS HAMILTON: I won't, until she puts me back on hers.

        JERRY: Hang on.

        Jerry clicks.

        JERRY: She wants to be back on yours.

        VALERIE: Fine. But only if you're off hers.

        JERRY: Hang on.

        Jerry clicks.

        JERRY: Fine, if I'm off yours.

        VALERIE: No, still me.

        JERRY: Sorry. Hang on.

        Jerry clicks.

        JERRY: Fine, if I'm off yours.

        MRS HAMILTON: I won't do it. It's my speed-dial, and I don't trust her.

        JERRY: Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.

        MRS HAMILTON: (conspiratorial) Alright. I'll hide you in one of the emergency
        buttons.

        JERRY: (hurried) Great, bye.

        Jerry clicks.

        JERRY: She said she'll do it.

        VALERIE: Great.

        There's another beep, as another call comes in.

        JERRY: Hang on.

        Jerry clicks.

        JERRY: Hello?

        [Yankee Stadium]

        George is at a public telephone, wearing the flesh-tone body-stocking 
        and
        looking thoroughly dejected.

        GEORGE: Jerry. I can't get fired.

        A passing fan spots him.

        FAN: Hey, body-suit man. 's up?

        He slaps palms with George, who doesn't look especially pleased by the
        attention. The fan points out George to more fans.

        FAN: (pointing) Hey, body-suit man.

        The fans gather round, making positive noises. George looks resigned to 
        his
        minor celebrity.

        [Putumayo]

        Gladys is behind the counter. Outside the door, Elaine peers in for a 
        second
        before she moves back out of sight. Then, a be-suited Kramer is pushed 
        into
        sight. He enters the store, smoking a cigar.

        KRAMER: Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist 
        uh,
        looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before 
        I invest
        millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get 
        the
        feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real 
        uh,
        gritty-gritty.

        He notices a bowl of chips beside the register and helps himself to some.

        GLADYS: Well, lemme show you what we have.

        KRAMER: Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.

        KRAMER: (re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?

        GLADYS: Yeah.

        KRAMER: Hmm-mmm.

        Kramer strolls over to a rack and grabs a selection of a half-dozen items. 
        He
        then heads for the changing room.

        GLADYS: Some of those are women's clothes.

        KRAMER: Oh, not a problem.

        He pulls the curtain shut. The sound of a pricing gun can be heard. The 
        clicking
        goes on for a couple of seconds, and then the gun is dropped. It lands 
        by
        Kramer's feet and breaks, Kramer then exacerbates his problem by kicking 
        the gun
        as he tries to retrieve it.

        [Yankee's Parking Lot]

        George is driving his car in a circle in the parking lot. Trailing behind 
        the
        car, on a rope, is a trophy which bounces and clatters on the tarmac. 
        George is
        leaning out of the car window, with a megaphone.

        GEORGE: Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs 
        mean
        nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George 
        Costanza.
        I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.

        [Putumayo]

        Gladys is still behind the counter. Valerie and Mrs Hamilton are browsing 
        the
        racks. Elaine enters and, holding her hand up to hide her face, she walks 
        over
        to the changing room, pulls back the curtain and enters.

        KRAMER: L'Occupado.

        ELAINE: Come on, what is taking you so long?

        KRAMER: Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.

        ELAINE: Plan B? There is no plan B.

        KRAMER: (holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every 

        single
        garment in the store.

        ELAINE: What?!

        KRAMER: They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These 
        clothes
        won't last five years without 'em.

        ELAINE: That's not gonna do anything.

        KRAMER: Patience.

        ELAINE: Alright. Forget it!

        KRAMER: What?

        ELAINE: You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!

        Elaine leaves, hurrying through the store with her face shielded again.

        GLADYS: Ladies, care for some chips?

        KRAMER: (emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.

        He takes a chip and dips it. As he loads the chip with the dip, a sachet 
        of
        dessicate falls from his sleeve into the dip. He doesn't notice, and after
        consuming the chip he deposits the bundle of clothing onto the counter.

        KRAMER: Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build 
        a
        rollercoaster instead.

        Kramer leaves. Mrs Hamilton comes over to the counter, takes a chip, dips 
        it
        into the dessicate-laced dip and eats it.

        [Steinbrenner's Office]

        George stands before Steinbrenner's desk, in his shirt-sleeves, nonchalantly
        eating something. He occasionally shrugs at Steinbrenner's remarks.

        STEINBRENNER: I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it 
        is
        in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe 
        that
        you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart 
        to say
        it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi...

        George looks expectant, as Steinbrenner reaches this point. Suddenly, 
        Mr Wilhelm
        enters the office.

        WILHELM: Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the 
        blame
        for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to 
        blame
        here, it's me.

        George stares at Wilhelm in disbelief.

        STEINBRENNER: What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You 
        got the
        crazies again?

        WILHELM: No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting 
        people
        today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.

        GEORGE: (agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!

        STEINBRENNER: Macho head games?

        WILHELM: (puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, 
        sir.

        STEINBRENNER: Wilhelm, you're fired. I owe you an apology, body-suit man. 
        Streak
        on. (rising) Now, if you gentlemen'll excuse me, I'm not going to the 
        game
        today, I'm gonna go outside and scalp some tickets. (heads toward the 
        door)
        Owner's box, that's gotta bring in forty bucks, no problem.

        GEORGE: Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!

        WILHELM: I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head 
        scout of
        the New York Mets.

        Wilhelm walks away toward the door, leaving George looking crushed.

        WILHELM: (singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet 
        the
        Mets.

        [Jerry's Apartment]

        KRAMER: I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates,
        those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.

        JERRY: She never sees the big picture.

        There's a knock at the door. Jerry opens it to reveal Newman.

        JERRY: Hello, Newman!

        NEWMAN: Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got 
        her
        cancellation in the mail.

        KRAMER: Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.

        NEWMAN: Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party 
        of a
        lifetime.

        KRAMER: Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone 
        warm
        and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New 
        York City.

        NEWMAN: Alright. Come back to my party, please.

        KRAMER: Jerry too, of course.

        NEWMAN: (reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?

        JERRY: No.

        NEWMAN: Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets 
        me a
        (suggestive) lot of Elaine.

        Jerry pulls a disgusted face.

        KRAMER: Deal?

        NEWMAN: To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand)

        KRAMER: (grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium.

        Kramer and Newman move to the door to leave. Newman stops as Jerry speaks 
        to
        him, and Kramer exits to his apartment.

        JERRY: By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, 
        did you
        book it for the millennium New Year?

        NEWMAN: (smug) As a matter of fact, I did.

        JERRY: Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there 
        was no
        year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and 
        one.
        Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.

        Newman absorbs the logic of Jerry's argument. His face twitches as he 
        realises
        his error.

        JERRY: Aww!

        Newman makes a noise redolent of his frustration - a sort of half-strangulated
        nasal squeak. He then waddles away after Kramer.

        [Mrs Hamilton's Apartment]

        Valerie and Mrs Hamilton sit on the couch. Mrs Hamilton looks nauseous.

        MRS HAMILTON: I don't feel well at all. I feel all dried-out inside.

        VALERIE: I'll call for help.

        She picks up the phone and pushes a button marked 'Poison Control'.

        [Mrs Hamilton's Apartment/Jerry's Apartment]

        JERRY: Hello?

        VALERIE: Who's this?

        JERRY: It's Jerry. Who's this?

        VALERIE: Uh, it's Valerie.

        JERRY: Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?

        VALERIE: I'll tell you what's up. My stepmother is violently ill, so I 
        hit the
        button for poison control and I get you!

        JERRY: Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!

        Valerie hangs up the phone.

        JERRY: Hello?


        [END] 
    

              [George and Jerry at a caf terrace] 

              (Missing the beginning.) 

              Jerry: Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series. 

              George: I got to give the players most of the credit for that. 

              Jerry: Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, 
              hotels, busses. 

              George: No, I don't know who was doing that. 

              Jerry: So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did? 
              

              George: They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe. 

              [Waitress (Lanette) comes with drinks] 

              Lanette: Here you go. Your latt, your cappuccino. 

              [Waitress leaves] 

              Jerry: Maybe I should ask her out? 

              George: She is a good waitress. 

              Jerry: That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's. 

              George: You're going to the Tony's? 

              Jerry: Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two 
              tickets. 

              George: Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's 
              the deal with those guys down in the pit?' 

              Jerry: They're musicians. That's not a joke. 

              George: It's a funny observation. 

              [George reads a letter] 

              George: Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months 
              full pay for doing nothing. 

              Jerry: They did it for three years. What's another few months. 

              George: I'm really going to do something with these three months. 
              

              Jerry: Like what? 

              George: I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order. 
              

              Jerry: I've always wanted to do that... 

              George: I'm gonna play frolf. 

              Jerry: You mean golf? 

              George: Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is 
              gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip 
              down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer
              of George!

              her.] 

              Elaine: Who's that? 

              Dugan: That's Sam, the new girl in the counting. 

              Walter: What's with her arms? They just hang like salamis. 

              Dugan: She walks like orangutan. 

              Elaine: Better call the zoo. 

              Dugan: Reer...

              Elaine: Yes, exactly. 

              Jerry: That's so strange. 

              Elaine: Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean 
              they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard. 

              Jerry: Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 
              10? 

              Elaine: That is so stupid.

              de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today. 

              Jerry: Like what? 

              George: I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to 
              it.

              to the Tony's.

              Kramer: Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy. 

              Elaine: You're going to the Tony's too? 

              Kramer: Roger that. 

              Jerry: Where are you sitting? 

              Kramer: Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They 
              don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just 
              park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.

              Kramer: Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.

              what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know 
              it he was her dude or just
              some dude. 

              Jerry: Dude! 

              [They make a high five.] 

              George: All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap. 
              

              Jerry: It's 10:30 in the morning? 

              George: I tell you; I'm wiped. 

              Jerry: So, has the summer of George already started or are you still 
              de-composing? 

              George: De-compressing. 

              [Kramer enters wearing a tuxedo and carrying a Tony statue.] 

              Kramer: Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you. 
              

              Jerry: You didn't give that thing back? 

              Kramer: Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the 
              media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe 
              how great it is to win. 

              Jerry: That's because you didn't win. 

              George: 'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale 
              diet doctor murder. 

              Kramer: Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch! 
              

              Jerry: You haven't even seen it. 


              Kramer: Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this 
              high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's! 
              

              George: What, Minelli's!?! 

              Kramer: No.

              Elaine: Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day. 

              Sam: No, don't apologize Elaine. I was thinking that maybe I should 
              swing my arms a little bit more. 

              Elaine: See, yeah, that's all I was saying. 

              Sam: How's this [Sam hits a pen case out of the table], or this 
              [swings a paper holder of the table and starts to clear the table 
              left and right]. 

              Elaine: Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...

              Lanette: Sorry, I'm running late. I just lost track of time. 

              Jerry: No rush. 

              [Lyle walks by wearing a towel.] 

              Lyle: Hey, Jerry! What's up? 

              Jerry to himself: I have absolutely no idea.

              Jerry: ..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing 
              food and beveridged! 

              [Kramer comes in with the Tony.] 

              George: Who's that? 

              Jerry: It's Kramer. 

              George: Hey Kramer. 

              Jerry: George says hi. 

              Kramer shouts to the telephone: Hi George! 

              George: How's that Tony? 

              Jerry: Why don't you just come over? 

              George: Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now? 
              

              Jerry: He's looking on to fridgerator. 

              George: Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles? 

              Jerry: I can't do this. 

              Kramer: So, what's George doing? 

              Jerry: He's not doing anything. Goodbye! 

              Kramer: So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You 
              wanna go? 

              Jerry: Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's? 

              Kramer: The Tony is taking me to Sardi's. 

              [Knock on the door. Jerry opens and it's Lanette.] 

              Jerry: Oh, hello. 

              Kramer: I'm going. 

              Lanette: Congratulations! 

              Kramer: Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people 
              I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone... 

              Jerry: All right, all right. 

              [Phone rings and Jerry answers.] 

              Jerry: I said no! [hangs up the phone.] 

              Lanette: Jerry, I just want to let you know; Lyle and I are completely 
              over. I'd rather be with you. 

              Jerry: Just me? No dudes or fellas? 

              Lanette: What you think? 

              Jerry: I can start right away. 

              [Phone rings again.] 

              Jerry: But not here. [They leave.] 

              Jerry's answering machine: 'I'm not here, leave a message.' 

              George on the answering machine: Jerry, what's happening? Come on, 
              pick up the phone.

              [At Sardi's. Kramer is sitting with a group of people.] 

              Kramer: ...so I said to him: Arthur, Artie come on, why does the 
              salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. 
              That's what people want to see. 

              Mr. Graham: Mr. Kramer, my name is Lewis Maxton Graham. I'm one 
              of the producers of 'Scarsdale surprise'. 

              Kramer: Hey, eh, Lew!

              [Elaine is talking to Peterman at her office.] 

              Peterman: Elaine, what did you want to talk me about? 

              Elaine: This. My office. Sam trashed my office. 

              Peterman: Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in 
              the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight. 

              Elaine: Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic 
              behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms. 
              

              Peterman: Woof! 

              Elaine: Do you mean "reer?" 

              Petermen: Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. [Leaves.]

              Elaine starts to sing] Crazy for feelings...

              [At Monk's. Jerry and Lanette.] 

              Jerry: I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends 
              who this would've be their whole life. 

              Lanette: Now, what time are you picking me up tonight? 

              Jerry: Eh, what? 

              Lanette: You got our reservation from Sfuzi's, didn't you? 

              Jerry: Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that. 

              Lanette: Should I ware the outfit I bought today? 

              Jerry: Sure. 

              Lanette: Which one? 

              Jerry: The one with the...[mumbles.] 

              Lanette: If I wanna get my hair cut I've gotta go now. Call me when 
              you get home. I wont be there, but leave a message so I know you 
              called. 

              Jerry: Ok, ok... 

              Lanette: Do you mind? 

              Jerry: No, I'll crab it. 

              [Lanette leaves and Jerry bangs his head to the table. George walks 
              in.] 

              George: Hey, I've done that today. 

              Jerry: What, did you lose your remote? 


              George: Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead. 

              Jerry: It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something. 
              

              George: [Laughs] Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed 
              up? 

              Jerry: Not. 

              George: No, no... 

              Jerry: No, because that's... 

              George: No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping 
              you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl 
              problems. Where do we end up? 

              Jerry: Here. 

              George: Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman 
              all by ourselves. 

              Jerry: I'm trying. 

              George: I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working 
              together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man. 

              Jerry: Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That 
              sounds about right! 

              ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
              

              [Kramer at Sardi's, talking with two producers.] 

              Mr. Graham: I'm sure how excited you are to have this very very 
              prestigious award. But you didn't have anything to do with the actual 
              production. 

              Kramer: No. 

              Mr. Graham: I don't think there's no way how we can allow you to 
              keep this Tony. Unless... 

              Kramer: Anything... 

              Malcolm: Are you familiar with our star, Raquel Welch? 

              Kramer: Oh yeah, she's fantastic.... 

              Mr. Graham: She's a train wreck. 

              Malcolm: There's a big tap dance number just before Jean Harris 
              leaves the (?) school to confront Dr Tarnover. 

              Mr. Graham: It is a gut wrenching scene. 

              Malcolm: But, Raquel Welch doesn't move her arms when she tap dances. 
              It's very distracting. 

              Mr. Graham: There's lot of this [swings his arms] in tap dancing. 
              

              Kramer: So, you'd like me to teach how to dance? 

              Malcolm: No, we want you to fire her. 

              ---------------------------------------------------------- 
              [5A. Jerry and Kramer.] 

              Jerry: Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch? 

              Kramer: Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that 
              when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side 
              of the stage and started dropping
              lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true. 

              Jerry: She seems very nice. 

              Kramer: Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what 
              these people are like. 

              Jerry: I'm in show business. 

              Kramer: Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive. 
              

              Jerry: I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would 
              help. 

              Kramer: Yayaya... 

              [Elaine enters.] 

              Elaine: Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's 
              trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she 
              left me. 

              [Takes a tape recorder and plays the tape.] 

              Sam's voice: Elaine...I am going to find you. If not in your office 
              then in the xerox room or the little conference room near to the 
              kitchen... 

              Elaine: She must've got a blueprint of the building or something. 
              

              Jerry: Did you tell Peterman about this? 

              Elaine: Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight. 
              

              Kramer: Cat fight? 

              Elaine: Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men 
              about a cat fight? 

              Kramer: Yeye cat fight! 

              Jerry: Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each 
              other there's a chance they might somehow kiss. 

              Kramer: T-t-t-t...

              Jerry: You got the tickets? 

              George: Yeah, two for the 7:15 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're 
              wearing the green sweater? 

              Jerry: I like it. 

              George: She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. 
              [Takes sweater out of his bag.] 

              Jerry: What? 

              George: Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails 
              done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me 
              you beep me, all right. Here you
              go, hey, hey, hey, hey...[sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.] Go 
              get'em you're a tiger! 

              Jerry: Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night 
              and she wants me to take care of the invitations. 

              George: A little notice would've helped! How many people? 

              Jerry: 35, and George, on the invitations... 

              George: I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go... 

              [Jerry leaves and Lanette joins him.] 

              Lanette: Right on time, I like that. 

              Jerry: I like your nails, that is a great color. 

              Lanette: Love the sweater. 

              Jerry: This old thing?

              Clerk: Okay, have you been in here before? 

              George: About a year ago. Wedding invitations. 

              Clerk: Right, how did that all work out? 

              George: No complaints. 

              Clerk: Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...[she 
              flips the sample book all the way to the end.] 

              George: Actually, [George flips the book back to the beginning] 
              I'll take these nice glossy ones.

              [Majestic theater, Raquel Welch's dressing room.] 

              Raquel: "You are a fraud Dr Tarnover. You haven't even been 
              to Scarsdale." 

              [Kramer knocks on the door and enters.] 

              Kramer: Ms. Welch. 


              Raquel: Who are you? 

              Kramer: Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers. 

              [Phone rings and Raquel answers.] 

              Raquel: Hello, Sidney! No, no I told you I don't want to do that! 
              If you bring it up again I will feed your genitals to a wolf! [hangs 
              up] Kids! You're still here. 

              Kramer: Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little 
              problem regarding, eh, your performance. 

              [Raquel kicks a chair out of her way.] 

              Raquel: What kind of problem? 

              Kramer: Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production 
              parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, 
              carnivals, water parks... 

              Raquel: Out with it! 

              Kramer: Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when 
              you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...

              George: Hey, frolf? 

              Guy: Yeah, you know we need a fourth for the back nine. You want 
              in? 

              [George looks up and sees Jerry on the other side and frisbee on 
              the other. Jerry says: "What's the deal with airplane peanuts?"]

              Lanette: Jerry, where are those invitations you were supposed to 
              get? If they don't go out today they're useless. 

              Jerry: But we're in towels. 

              Lanette: Jerry. 

              Jerry: all right. One second.

              leave them with her doorman! 

              Lanette comes by: Did you shave your chest hair? 

              Jerry: No. [Lanette leaves.] Did you at least pick them up? 

              George: Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had. 

              Jerry: Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George. 
              

              George: All right, All right, keep your towel on. 

              Jerry:...what? 

              George: It's a joke. 

              Jerry: All right, that's not bad. Now get over here! 

              [George leaves from his apartment and comes down the stairs. He 
              slips on an invitation and falls on his back.]

              [Elaine is on the street and plays a tape to two police officers.] 
              

              Sam's voice on the tape:...if not in your apartment then in the 
              laundry room or the ATM in the building across the street or the 
              watch shop! 

              Elaine: Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a 
              psycho! 

              Cop#1: 'Reer.' 

              Elaine: Look, just because I'm a woman... 

              Cop#2: 'Mauau.' 

              Cop#1: 'Meeow.' 

              --- 
              [Raquel Welch walks down the street.] 

              Raquel: I don't move my arms when I dance. That's my signature! 
              
              --- 

              Elaine: Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about 
              ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks. 

              Cop#1: What do you mean? 

              Elaine: Like this...[imitates the walk with her arms hanging.] 

              [Raquel Welch comes towards her.] 

              Raquel: What the hell is that? Are you making fun of my dancing? 
              

              Elaine: Aren't you Raquel Welch? 

              Raquel: You know who I am. Now, what are you doing? 

              Elaine: Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms... 

              Raquel: That's it, you are going down. 

              Cop#1: Ooh, cat fight. 
              ---------------------------------------------------- 

              [The New York Hospital. Jerry and Kramer.] 

              Kramer: So how's George? 

              Jerry: I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? [Kramer 
              holds a broken Tony] 

              Kramer: Tony. 

              Jerry: What happened to you? 

              Kramer: Raquel Welch! 

              Jerry: Yikes. 

              [Elaine comes. She has a scars on her face.] 

              Jerry: What happened to you? 

              Elaine: Raquel Welch! 

              Kramer: The woman is a menace. 

              Elaine: Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly. 
              

              Jerry: Cat fight with Raquel Welch. 

              Kramer: Yey eye ca-catfight. 

              [George is wheeled in on a hospital bed.] 

              Elaine: My god, George! 

              George: I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels? 

              Jerry: Back on the rack. 

              George: With the two of us? 

              Jerry: I think we're still a man short. 

              [Doctor comes.] 

              Doctor: Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. 
              Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to 
              a period of extreme inactivity.
              But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's 
              a good chance you may, one day, walk again. 

              [Doctor leaves.] 

              Kramer: Well, that's good news. 


              Elaine: Wow, invitations again... 

              Kramer: Yeah, that's weird. 

              Elaine: All right, well...you want to grab some coffee? 

              Jerry: Yeah... 

              Kramer: I'd like to get some coffee. 

              [Jerry, Kramer and Elaine leave.] 

              George: This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer 
              of George. 


              [George is at the hospital physical therapy, trying to walk, leaning 
              on parallel bars. Next to him, Sam tries to walk with swinging her 
              arms.] 

              Therapist: Now, swing them...swing...swing them, just swing them. 
              

              Sam: I can't do it. It's hard! 

              [George is at end of the bars and falls down. He tries to get up.] 
              

              George: Still a little summer left. 


              Jerry, on the phone: "Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh."
              George, knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese 
              voice:
              "Chinese food!"
              Jerry, hanging up the phone: "Oh! There's my Chinese food, 
              I gotta run. All
              you."
              George: "Who was it?"
              Jerry: "I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting 
              me a new SAAB."
              George: "What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's 
              blood out of it?"
              Jerry: "No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole 
              thing up for me?
              Frank Merman."
              George: "Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy."
              Jerry: "Why? He's harmless."
              George: "Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was 
              jealous. Felt
              like he was the summer me."
              Jerry: "He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer 
              me. Whitey Fisk,
              the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris."
              George: "I made him up."
              Jerry: "So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?"
              George: "No."
              Jerry: "Too bad. It was erotic."
              Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment: "Well... I've had it with 
              these
              jackbooted thugs!"
              Jerry: "'Pottery Barn'?"
              Kramer: "I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That 
              makes eight
              this month."
              George, holding a magazine cover: "Mira Sorvino. Think she'd 
              go out with me?"
              Jerry: "Why don't you just throw 'em out?"
              Kramer: "Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. 
              And now,
              it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt."
              Jerry, taking a catalog: "Can I have one? I need one of those 
              old-looking
              phones. So you wanna grab a bite?"
              George: "I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks."
              Jerry: "So call now."
              George: "I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few
              you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie 
              the one
              that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?"
              Jerry: "That's him."
              George: "Is he still nuts?"
              Jerry: "What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty 
              minutes of 'So,
              who's from out of town?'"

              Puddy, finishing eating: "Seriously, is this the best okra 
              you've ever had,
              or what?"
              Elaine: "Mmm. De-lish."
              Puddy: "Delish?"
              Elaine: "Delish. You know, short for delicious."
              Puddy: "Oh, like scrump."
              Elaine: "Yeah."
              Puddy, leaving: "I'm gonna be late. See ya later."
              Jack: "Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?"
              Elaine, passing him the ketchup: "Oh, sure."
              Jack: "Thank you."
              Heraldic harp sounds as Elaine looks at Jack's face

              Estelle, answering the phone: "Hello?"
              George: "Hey, it's Georgie."
              Estelle: "Let me put your father on the phone."
              George: "Ma!"
              Frank: "Who is this?"
              George: "Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the 
              other day, and,
              you know what, you were right."
              Estelle, feigning a Chinese, muffled voice: "Chinese food."
              Frank, hanging up: "Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. 
              Talk to you
              later."
              George: "Chinese food?"

              Kramer, throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store: "Hey, 
              you like
              sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?"

              Jerry: "So, maybe they had Chinese food?"
              George: "After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing 
              stun
              grenades."
              Jerry: "Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese 
              food, there's
              leftovers."
              Elaine, entering Jerry's apartment: "Well, gentlemen. Lainie 
              is... in love."
              George: "That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food 
              leftovers."
              Elaine: "Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, 
              totally unreal,
              fairy tale moment."
              Jerry: "It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?"
              Elaine: "Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?"
              George: "Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go."
              Jerry: "So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new 
              guy, in a big pot
              of love stew."
              Elaine: "Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I 
              see if this new
              guy can... handle the workload."
              Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment: "Will you look at this? 
              More catalogs!
              'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these
              companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point."
              Jerry: "Stop the mail?"
              Kramer: "That's... even better!"

              Frankie: "Jerry!"
              Jerry: "Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?"
              Frankie: "This is it."
              Jerry: "Inside the van?"
              Frankie: "It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked 
              about how cool
              it would be to have a van and just drive?"
              Jerry: "We were ten."
              Frankie: "Come on. Let's take it for a spin."
              Jerry: "I don't want a van."
              Elaine: "Well, just tell him you want the SAAB."
              Jerry: "You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. 
              When we were in
              camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and 
              sit in it."
              Elaine: "Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper 
              sticker that
              says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'"
              Jerry: "Always helpful."

              Estelle: "Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?"
              George: "Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called 
              me back."
              Estelle: "Uh... the phone broke."
              Frank: "Well, we got to get moving."
              George: "What? Where are you going?"
              Frank: "We have a catered affair."
              George: "You're going like that?"
              Frank, leaving the kitchen: "It's creative black tie. Move, 
              woman."
              George, checking the fridge: "No Chinese leftovers. George 
              is gettin'
              suspicious."

              Jack: "Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late."
              Heraldic harp sounds as Elaine looks at Jack's face
              Jack: "I'm gonna be in the can."
              Elaine: "Okay, Jack."
              Elaine, to the cashier: "Can I use your phone?"
              Cashier (Ruthie Cohen): "Sure."
              Elaine, over the phone: "Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. 
              Yeah, that's
              right. Again."

              Frankie, in the van with Jerry: "Nice captain's chairs, huh?"
              Jerry: "Aye, aye."
              Frankie: "Oh, there's a spot. Just back up."
              Large-vehicle reverse beeping starts
              Jerry: "Hold on. There must be a truck backing up."
              Frankie: "No, that's us."
              Jerry: "Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if 
              I decided that
              it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York 
              City. Is
              there maybe some way I could exchange it?"
              Frankie: "You don't like the van?"
              Jerry: "No, no, no. Just hypothetically."

              Frankie: "I gotta go to the park."
              Jerry: "No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a 
              van guy."

              Kramer, showing Jerry his mailbox: "Check it out. Rain and 
              sleet may not stop
              them, but let's see them get by... these bricks."
              Jerry: "Where'd you get the bricks?"
              Kramer: "Jerry, the whole building is brick."
              Jerry: "So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm 
              gonna try to
              sell the van to a lot."
              Kramer: "A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell 
              it privately."
              Jerry: "I don't think I want to meet the people that are in 
              the market for a
              used van."

              Kramer: "Come on, Jerry, just let me help you."
              Jerry: "OK."
              Kramer: "All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 
              'For sale. A big,
              juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'"
              Jerry: "I don't want to trade."
              Kramer: "No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their 
              buying bone."
              Jerry: "Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're 
              puttin' it in my
              box now."
              Kramer: "Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing 
              me, and
              pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk 
              to them."

              Elaine: "Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is 
              Jack."
              Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face

              Postal Employee: "May I help you?"
              Kramer: "Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail."
              Postal Employee: "Certainly. How long would you like us to 
              hold it?"
              Kramer: "Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, 
              permanently."
              Newman: "I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your 
              three hour break?
              Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail."
              Kramer: "Oh, yes, I am."
              Newman: "What about your bills?"
              Kramer: "The bank can pay 'em."
              Newman: "The bank. What about your cards and letters?"
              Kramer: "E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams,
              holograms."
              Newman: "All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. 
              What do you
              think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know 
              the half of
              what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you."
              Supervisor: "Is everything all right here, Postal Employee 
              Newman?"
              Newman: "Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. 
              Isn't it, Mr.
              Kramer?"
              Kramer: "Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!"

              George, surprising his parents in the kitchen: "Welcome back."
              Estelle: "Oh!"
              George: "Quick for a... catered affair."
              Frank: "I don't know what you mean."
              George: "You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know 
              what's going on!"
              Frank: "George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love 
              you like a son,
              but even parents have limits."
              Estelle: "The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with 
              the calls."
              Frank: "What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed 
              to be our
              time."
              George: "I'm not following."
              Frank: "We're cuttin' you lose."
              George: "You're cuttin' me loose?"
              Frank: "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to 
              your mother."

              George: "They don't want to see me anymore!"
              Jerry: "But this is what you've always wanted."
              George: "It is. I'm just not ready yet."
              Jerry: "Aw, that's kind of sweet."
              George: "Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore 
              me. Heh heh.
              Well, they better think again."
              Jerry: "Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?"
              George: "You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her."
              Jerry: "Mother of God."
              George: "One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. 
              They'll be all
              over me. Who is this guy?"
              Jerry: "That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. 
              I think he may
              have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what 
              is this?"
              On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz, 
              chanting
              "Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!"
              Jerry: "That is the guy!"
              George: "Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?"
              Jerry: "No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just 
              remembering
              this old commercial."
              George: "That's pretty pathetic."
              Jerry: "I know. They're not even related."
              Elaine, entering Jerry's apartment: "Hey."
              George: "Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going."
              Jerry: "Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. So, what do 
              you know about
              this Jack fellow?"
              Elaine: "Isn't he the best?"
              Jerry: "Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?"
              Elaine: "Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. 
              It's not
              much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity."
              Jerry, turning on the commercial: "Right, quiet dignity. As 
              opposed to, say,
              this?"
              On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz, 
              chanting
              "Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!"
              Elaine: "Oh, no."
              Jerry: "Oh, yes."

              Jerry, answering the phone: "Hello? Yeah, the van is still 
              for sale. Sure,
              come on buy."
              Kramer, rushing into Jerry's apartment: "Yeah, I called about 
              the van."

              George, at dinner with his cousin: "Some more merlot?"
              Rhisa: "Yeah, thanks."
              George: "Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very 
              attractive."
              Rhisa: "What?"
              George: "I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop 
              myself from...
              wanting you."
              Rhisa: "You want to borrow money, right?"
              George: "No, no. I-I just want us to be... together."
              Rhisa: "All right."
              George: "All right?"
              Rhisa: "Let's go for it."
              George: "Well... we could dance around it a little first."
              Rhisa, playing "footsie": "Nah. Let's be bad, George. 
              Let's be really... bad."
              George: "Whoa! Whoa! Geez!"

              Kramer, inspecting Jerry's van: "So, how come you're selling 
              it?"
              Jerry: "You know why I'm selling it. I hate it."
              Kramer: "How many miles?"
              Jerry: "Two."
              Kramer: "City or highway?"
              Jerry: "Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?"
              Kramer, breaking the antenna: "Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm 
              not gonna be
              pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not 
              paying for
              that."
              Jerry: "All right, just get out of here."
              Kramer: "All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very 
              interested in the
              van."
              Jerry: "OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this 
              van today?'"
              Kramer, pointing to the newspaper ad: "Well, I don't really 
              have any money.
              But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'."
              Jerry: "You put that in!"
              Kramer, pulling out an undershirt: "And I'm glad I did. Here."
              Jerry: "You want to trade me an undershirt?"
              Kramer: "No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's 
              undershirt. He
              took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it."
              Jerry: "That's disgusting."
              Kramer: "Well, it's my final offer."

              Puddy: "You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman."
              Elaine: "Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's 
              just put it
              behind us, and we can continue like this never happened."
              Puddy: "Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and 
              you see the Maytag
              repairman."
              Elaine: "You're not taking me back?"
              Puddy, leaving: "That's right."
              Elaine: "He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. 
              Nobody..."

              Kramer, handing out anti-mail pamphlets: "Here you go. Mail 
              is evil. Pass it
              on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend."

              Woman: "Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?"
              Kramer: "Because we're blind to their tyranny."
              Woman: "Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?"
              Kramer: "Yeah. Move along, Betty."
              Frankie: "Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?"
              Kramer: "Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood
              memorabilia."
              Frankie: "I'm, uh, I'm so stupid."
              Kramer: "What?"
              Frankie, running away: "I'm so stupid. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry."
              Kramer: "Yeah, nice to meet you."

              Jerry: "She's into it?"
              George: "She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine."
              Jerry: "So have your parents found out about it?"
              George: "She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have 
              a real future
              together."
              Jerry: "Brave new world, alright."
              Kramer, entering Monk's: "Hey, you guys."
              Jerry: "Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?"
              Kramer: "Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post 
              office today,
              and not one person went in."
              Jerry: "It's Sunday."
              George: "Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?"
              Kramer: "Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution."
              George: "Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket."
              Jerry: "Hey, I want my van keys back."
              Kramer: "Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's 
              t-shirt."
              Jerry: "Are you insane? Give 'em to me."
              Kramer: "No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow 
              it. Yeah, he
              wants to move some of George's stuff into storage."
              George: "Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This 
              is perfect.
              I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides 
              the door
              open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter."
              Kramer: "Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and 
              he was very upset
              that I had your wheels."
              Jerry: "Oh, no, not Frankie."
              Kramer: "Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running 
              into the
              park."
              Jerry: "Oh, no, the woods! The hole!"

              Kramer, seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck: "Hey."
              Newman: "Kramer, what the hell are you doing?"
              Kramer: "I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else."
              Newman: "Not that!"
              Kramer: "What?"
              Newman: "You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking 
              to you, but
              I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen: you 
              may be
              walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail 
              truck will
              slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe 
              even
              trust, will offer to give you a lift."
              Kramer: "Are you through?"
              Newman: "No! And no one will ever see you again!"
              Kramer: "Are you through?"
              Newman: "Yes. No, wait! OK, yes."
              Newman, seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer: 
              "Quick! Get
              in!"
              Kramer: "Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was 
              going down."
              Newman: "There's another way it can go down, and it's going 
              down right now!"
              Kramer: "No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman 
              I know!"
              Newman: "I know you know, but you don't know what I know."
              Kramer, being grabbed by the security officials: "Hey!"

              Jerry: "Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?"
              Hole Digger: "My name is Edgar."
              Jerry: "Have a nice night."
              Hole Digger: "Thank you."

              Frankie, digging a hole, talking to himself, and seeing Jerry's 
              van pull up
              near him: "Stupid... so stupid! Jerry?"
              Rhisa: "All right, George. I'm ready."
              George: "Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading 
              on my
              dashboard compass. Where are my parents?"
              Rhisa: "Geor-gie..."
              Frankie, running up to the van and yelling through the window: "Is 
              this
              Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?!"
              Rhisa, hearing Frankie as George runs to the back of the van: "Wait. 
              What's
              he saying?"
              George: "I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!"
              Rhisa: "No, they caught him."
              George, running out and away from the van: "I knew it wasn't 
              Berkowitz!"
              Frankie, seeing George running away: "Ohh..."

              Elaine: "So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with 
              Jack.'"
              Jack: "Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today."
              Elaine: "Really, what was the first?"
              Jack, pulling out his Wiz hat: "They're bringing me back. Yeah. 
              I'm the Wiz
              again."
              Elaine: "What?"
              Jack, dancing around: "I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!"
              Elaine: "Well what, what about your fact-checking job?"
              Jack, dancing around: "Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the 
              Wiz! I'm the Wiz
              and noooobody beats me!"

              Jerry, finding Frankie, in his hole, in the woods: "Frankie... 
              come on out of
              there."
              Frankie: "You hate the van."
              Jerry: "But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being 
              a van guy,
              it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people."
              Frankie: "So, can we go for a ride?"
              Jerry: "Yeah, let's just get out of here."
              Hole Digger #2, eyeing the empty hole, and getting into it: "Are 
              you done
              with that?"

              Frank, coming upon the van, supposedly left by Kramer for him, in 
              the woods:
              "Good. He left the door unlocked."
              Estelle: "Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?"
              Frank: "Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here."
              Estelle, looking inside of the van: "Wow!"
              Frank, reclining the seats in the van to a bed: "Hey, look 
              at this. Hoochie
              mama!"

              Postmaster General: "Oh, my goodness. What have they done to 
              you here?"
              Kramer: "Huh? Who are you?"
              Postmaster General: "Well, you can just call me Henry."
              Kramer: "Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?"
              Postmaster General: "Last time I checked."
              Kramer: "Henry... can I get out of here now?"
              Postmaster General: "Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, 
              after all, I drove
              all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you."
              Kramer: "Oh?"
              Postmaster General: "I even had to cancel a round of golf with 
              the secretary
              of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?"
              Kramer: "Yeah."
              Postmaster General: "Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of 
              your material
              here. I gotta be honest with you: you make a pretty strong case. 
              I mean, just
              imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood
              handing out pottery catalogs, door to door."
              Kramer: "Yeah! Ha ha."
              Postmaster General: "Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn 
              serious about it.
              In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, 
              it's the
              job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand 
              why
              I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf."
              Kramer: "I'm very, very sorry."
              Postmaster General: "Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack 
              of mail out
              at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't 
              you Mr.
              Kramer?"
              Kramer: "Sure do!"
              Postmaster General, receiving a salute from Kramer: "Now, that's 
              better."
              Kramer, seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his 
              head,
              escorted by a security man: "Geez. Newman?"
              Newman, whimpering: "Tell the world my story."

              Jerry: "Hey, George!"
              George: "Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!"
              Jerry: "What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman."
              George: "Oh. The summer me."
              Frankie: "The winter me."
              Jerry: "You must be George's cousin."
              Rhisa: "Girlfriend."
              Jerry: "All right."
              George, seeing Jerry's van shaking: "What is that? That van's 
              a-rockin'."
              Jerry: "Don't go a-knockin'."
              Estelle, after George opens the van door: "Oh, my god!"
              George, seeing his parents being "intimate": "Oh, 
              my god!"
              Frankie: "Now you gotta sell this van."
              Jerry: "Oh, yeah."


              Frank: "What you saw in that van was a natural expression of 
              a man's love for
              his lady."
              George: "Ohhhh..."
              Estelle: "Your father's right. It's beautiful."
              Frank: "And it was safe."
              George: "Oh, God..."
              Frank: "Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and 
              I..."
              George: "Oh... make it stop."

              Jerry, [tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done]: 
              "Any
              second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready."
              Melissa, [appearing in the kitchen stark naked]: "Oh, fantastic! 
              I'm
              starving."
              Jerry, [looking at her]: "How about that."
              Melissa, [eating the waffles]: "Mmm-hmm."


              George: "She ate breakfast naked?"
              Jerry: "She didn't even want a napkin."
              George: "I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom 
              naked... I
              have never had living-room naked."
              Jerry: "Oh, it's a scene."
              George: "It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did 
              she, uh, did she
              frolic?"
              Jerry: "I don't really have enough room."
              George, [seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's]: "Yeah. 
              Hey, Lainie,
              Puddy."
              Elaine: "Hey!"
              Puddy: "Hi."
              Jerry: "Hey."
              Puddy, [heading towards the bathroom]: "I got to make a pit 
              stop."
              Elaine, [sitting down in the booth]: "'Kay."
              Jerry: "Back together?"
              Elaine: "His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd 
              give it
              another shot."
              Jerry: "Ah..."
              Elaine: "So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke."
              George: "'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?"
              Elaine: "He called to apologize for standing me up five years 
              ago."
              Jerry: "Why now?"
              Elaine: "A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine 
              is you have to
              apologize to anyone you've ever wronged."
              George: "Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling 
              back to me."
              Jerry: "Still with the neck hole?"
              George: "Still upset. Very upset."
              Elaine: "What neck hole?"
              George: "Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years 
              ago? He had that
              very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue."
              Elaine, becoming board: "Faster."
              George: "I asked if I could borrow a sweater."
              Jerry: "A cashmere sweater."
              George: "I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front 
              of the whole
              party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'"
              Elaine: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
              George: "Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!"
              Elaine: "Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or 
              is it 'cause of
              your neck?"
              Jerry: "No, I think the head does most of the stretching."
              George: "Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the 
              party in some
              cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time."
              Elaine: "I really think it's the size of your neck."
              George: "It's my head!"
              Elaine: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"

              Elaine: "Hey."
              Peggy: "Hey."
              Elaine: "Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, 
              you and I
              are the only ones who use this bathroom."
              Peggy, somewhat sarcastically: "Yeah. Great."
              [Elaine is surprised to see Peggy get a seat protector for the toilet]

              Kramer: "You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, 
              I just wanted to
              hop in the shower."
              Jerry: "That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?"
              Kramer: "Showering. How long does it take you?"
              Jerry: "Ten minutes."
              Kramer, [seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment]: "Ten minutes? 
              That's
              kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?"
              Elaine: "Ten minutes."
              Kramer: "Let me smell you."
              Elaine: "All right. Whiff away."
              Kramer, [after delicately sniffing Elaine]: "Uh... that's not 
              bad at all."
              Elaine, [holding Kramer off from getting another whiff]: "Hup! 
              That's it."
              Kramer, [backing off]: "OK."
              Elaine: "So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and 
              I see Peggy
              using a seat protector."
              Jerry: "So?"
              Elaine: "So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're 
              like
              roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?"
              Jerry, [seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over]: 
              "I
              think the damage is probably already done."
              Jerry, [interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the 
              soda]: "All
              right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene."
              Elaine, [eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda]: "Yeah, 
              you're
              probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks."
              Jerry: "Mmm."
              Kramer: "Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some 
              changes. Get
              wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- 
              focus!"

              Jerry, [playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend]: "Zephyr? 
              That is not a
              word."
              Melissa: "Do you challenge?"
              Jerry: "No, I do not challenge."
              Melissa: "66 points. Ha ha."
              Jerry: "I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where 
              you'd hide the
              tiles."
              Melissa: "You want some more ice tea?"
              Jerry: "Sure."
              Melissa, [coughing loudly, while Jerry's expression turns to disgust]: 
              "Wrong
              pipe."

              George, [at Monk's with Jerry]: "So she coughed."
              Jerry: "Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man."
              George: "Everything goes with naked."
              Jerry: "When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles 
              that suddenly
              spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball 
              in his
              stomach in slow motion."
              George: "Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much 
              mental energy I
              expend just trying to picture women naked?"
              Jerry: "But the thing you don't realize is that there's good 
              naked and bad
              naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's 
              Hanke."
              George: "All right. It's grovel time."
              Hanke: "Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've 
              been going
              through the Twelve Steps."
              George: "What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?"
              Hanke: "Yeah. Making amends."
              George: "Important step. Maybe the most important."
              Hanke: "Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, 
              you know, when
              we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may even 
              have
              called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you noticed, 
              but I
              always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry."
              Jerry: "Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying 
              it."
              Hanke: [eyeing George, who's looking expectedly up at him]: "Great. 
              Great.
              Well, I'll see you guys later."

              Kramer, [entering Jerry's apartment]: "Well, I just got out 
              of a 27-minute
              shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. 
              Yeah, I
              think what I kept is even stronger now."
              Jerry, [pointing to Kramer's hair]: "You got some suds over 
              here."

              Kramer, [noticing suds all over his clothes and body]: "Wha...? 
              Oh, man!
              Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what 
              I'm doing
              wrong."
              Jerry: "Oh, come on!"
              Kramer: "No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!"
              Jerry: "You promise you'll never come in here again?"
              Kramer, [chuckling]: "Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that."

              Jerry, [standing in the bathtub]: "Now my sense of it is that 
              you're probably
              wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another."
              Kramer: "Well, that's how cats do it."
              Jerry: "But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you 
              want to use
              gravity."
              Kramer: "OK. Let's turn the water on now. "
              Jerry: "No, I told you, it's just a dry run."
              George, [entering Jerry's bathroom]: "Well, Hanke's moved on 
              to Step Ten. He
              was spotted taking personal inventory."
              Jerry: "That's Step Ten?"
              George: "All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a 
              prayer, and he's
              done. Do you believe this?"
              Kramer: "Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?"
              Jerry: "You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer."
              Kramer: "Well, this has all been one big tease!"

              Elaine, [moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk]: 
              "These
              proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this 
              will work."
              Peggy, [having seen Elaine touch her nearly full water bottle]: 
              "I'm... gonna
              get another bottle of water."
              Walter,[ taking a final swig from his own water bottle]: "Here, 
              take mine.
              There's a little left."
              Peggy, [gulping down Walter's water]: "Oh, thanks, Walter. 
              Ahh!"

              Hanke, [talking with two men in Monk's]: "Guys, there's no 
              doubt that the pay
              is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice 
              cream."
              Man #1: "You get pretty buff forearms."
              Hanke: "I don't know if I'm into that."
              George, [entering Monk's]: "Oh, hello, Hanke, others."
              Hanke: "George."
              George: "You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... 
              I didn't get my
              apology."
              Hanke: "Apology? For what?"
              George: "A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game 
              giveaway
              Metlife windbreaker?"
              Hanke: "George, come on, not that neck hole thing."
              George: "Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate 
              it if you would
              say you're sorry."
              Hanke: "No way, you would've completely stretched it out."
              George: "You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! 
              Step Nine."
              Hanke: "All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, 
              very sorry. I'm so
              sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to 
              find its way
              through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater."

              Kramer, [taking notes on showering men at the YMCA]: "Now see, 
              that's smart.
              Constant motion. Wow."
              Man in Shower, [seeing Kramer staring at the showering man]: "Hey!"
              Kramer: "Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this 
              guy's really
              showing me something!"
              Kramer, [walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye]: 
              "You got a
              steak?"
              Jerry: "What happened to you?"
              Kramer: "Ah, people in this city are crazy."
              Jerry, [giving him a steak from the fridge]: "Here ya go."
              Kramer, [applying the steak to his eye]: "Thanks, buddy. Oh... 
              yes! Hey, you
              got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak."
              Jerry: "What?"
              Kramer: "Yeah, a different one."
              Jerry, [closing the door on him]: "Oh!"
              Kramer: "Jerry!"

              Melissa, [wheeling out Jerry's bicycle]: "OK, Jerry. I fixed 
              that bike."
              Jerry: "Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. 
              It's just for
              show."
              Melissa, [crouching down next to the bike]: "I should really 
              clean those
              bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk."
              Jerry: "Please don't crouch."
              Melissa: "Ouch! Caught my skin."
              Jerry: "Oh, that's bad. Especially that area."
              Melissa: "You got anything to snack on?"
              Jerry: "Uhh..."
              Melissa, [grabbing the pickle jar and straining to open it]: "Oh, 
              pickles!
              Unnhhhh! It's a tough one."
              Jerry: "Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!"
              Melissa, [finally opening the jar]: "Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna 
              leave a welt.
              Look at that."
              Jerry, [leaving the room]: "I can't. I can't look anymore. 
              I-I-I've seen too
              much."

              Elaine: "Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that 
              you find so
              offensive?"
              Peggy: "You seem to be with a lot of men."
              Elaine: "What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You 
              know, I mean,
              we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here 
              or... or
              there, but, wh-why is this your business?"
              Peggy: "It's not. Good day."
              Elaine, [leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her 
              butt,
              sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob]: 
              "Oh. All
              right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about 
              some for
              your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? 
              That's good,
              isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy."

              Jerry: "Well, technically he did apologize."
              George: "Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible 
              sketch. He was
              riffing! Riffing! On my pain!"
              Jerry: "So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the 
              original
              apology?"
              George: "That's right. I'm two in the hole!"
              Jerry: "Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She 
              did a full body
              flex on a pickle jar."
              George: "Did you explain to her about the good naked and the 
              bad naked?"
              Jerry: "Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?"
              George: "Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You 
              still got that
              belt sander?"
              Jerry: "Yeah."
              George, [going into the bathroom]: "Well, you on all fours, 
              that thing
              vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!"
              Jerry, [answering the ringing phone]: "Hello?"
              Kramer: "Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!"
              Jerry: "World War I plane?"
              Kramer: "No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to 
              get out of the
              shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where 
              I want to
              be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and 
              now I
              ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew."
              Jerry: "When are ya gettin' out?"
              Kramer: "I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy."

              Peterman: "Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick."
              Elaine: "Oh, please."
              Peterman: "She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense 
              malaise."
              Elaine: "Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?"
              Peterman: "I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed."
              Elaine: "Yeah, let me tell you something: this is all in her 
              mind, OK? She is
              insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, 
              rubbed
              her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, 
              she's a
              wacko."

              George, [at Monk's]: "So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?"
              Sponsor: "Sponsor."
              George: "Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy."
              Sponsor: "He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten."
              George: "Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you 
              can go through
              them pretty quick. You can get through six a day."
              Sponsor: "Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?"
              George: "I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead 
              of an
              apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me."
              Sponsor: "I'm not sure what you want me to do."
              George: "Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let 
              him move up!
              When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three 
              years 'cause

              I kept losing the Pinewood Derby."
              Sponsor: "You're quite upset, George."
              George: "Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two."
              Sponsor: "Admit there's a higher power?"
              George: "Yeah, let him chew on that for a while."
              Sponer: "You know George, I think I can help you. We're having 
              a meeting
              tomorrow. Why don't you just come by?"
              George: "All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much."
              George, [giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench]: "By 
              the way, my
              uncle was an alcoholic, so..."

              Kramer, [on the phone in the shower]: "Lomez, you're not listenin'. 
              Jerry
              likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. 
              Calm
              down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, 
              I'll call
              ya back."

              Melissa, [naked on the couch]: "What are you doing?"
              Jerry, [naked, carrying a belt sander]: "I found a rough spot 
              on the kitchen
              floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here."
              Melissa: "No, not that. Why are you naked?"
              Jerry: "I thought naked is good."
              Melissa, [eyeing him]: "This isn't good naked."

              Sponsor, [seeing George at the meeting]: "George, here, have 
              a seat."
              George, [sitting down]: "Where's Hanke?"
              Sponsor, [motioning to the leader]: "Shhhhh."
              Leader: "OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous."
              George: "What? Rate-aholics?"
              Sponsor: "George, this can help you."
              George: "Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge."
              Leader: "Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these 
              meetings."
              George: "Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!"
              Leader: "Please don't call me 'Pinhead'."
              George: "I'm losin' it!"

              Jerry, [in Monk's with George]: "He took you to Rage-aholics? 
              Why?"
              George: "Probably because this whole Universe is against me!"
              Jerry: "You've got a little rage."
              George: "I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes 
              me so mad!"
              Jerry: "By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work."
              George: "This bread has nuts in it!"
              Jerry, [seeing Elaine enter Monk's]: "Oh, great. Elaine. What 
              is wrong with
              my body?"
              Elaine: "Chicken wing shoulder blades."
              Jerry: "That's it?"
              Elaine: "No, but that's one problem. Why?"
              Jerry: "Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa 
              the other day--"
              Elaine: "Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good 
              look for a
              man."
              George: "Why not? It's a good look for a woman."
              Elaine: "Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male 
              body is
              utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep."
              Jerry: "So you don't think it's attractive?"
              Elaine: "It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's 
              simian."
              George: "Well, some women like it."
              Elaine: "Hmm. Sickies."

              Kramer, [in the shower, reading an instruction manual]: "Installing 
              your
              Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage 
              lot.
              Oh, come on, Clarkman."
              Puddy, [staring into space, picks up the phone]: "Puddy."
              Kramer: "Is, uh, David Puddy there?"
              Puddy: "This is Puddy."
              Kramer: "Well, this is Kramer."
              Puddy: "I know."
              Kramer: "Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install 
              a garbage
              disposal?"
              Puddy: "Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch 
              hasp from the
              auxiliary drainage line."
              Kramer: "No. It says 'main line'."
              Puddy: "It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?"
              Kramer: "Yeah."
              Puddy, seeing Elaine come in: "Hey, man, I'll call you back. 
              I'll talk you
              through it."
              Kramer: "Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy."

              Elaine: "Hey, Puddy."
              Puddy: "Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for 
              a balloon
              bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when 
              you see him."
              Elaine: "Balloon bouquet? For who?"
              Puddy: "Peggy took a turn for the worst."
              Elaine: "Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?"
              Puddy: "That's what he said."
              Elaine: "I don't believe this woman."
              Puddy: "Talk to me, Babe."
              Elaine: "She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs 
              make her sick."
              Puddy: "Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about."
              Elaine: "Huh?"
              Puddy, showing her his necklace: "I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. 
              Ten years."
              Elaine: "What is this symbol?"
              Puddy: "It's a germ."

              Peggy: "Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're 
              currently
              sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have 
              any problem
              with germs."
              Puddy: "Don't you? Elaine."
              [Elaine slowly creeps up towards Peggy]
              Peggy, flinching away: "Please!"
              Puddy: "I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago 
              waking up in
              bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex."
              Peggy: "Really?"
              Puddy: "I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old 
              bedroom slippers
              she slogs around in."
              Elaine: "Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies."
              Puddy: "They're bacteria traps."
              Peggy: "So you... just learned to live with it?"
              Puddy: "For the most part."
              Elaine: "OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day."

              Jerry: "So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't 
              you feel this is
              better?"
              Melissa: "This is nice."
              Jerry: "Yes, clothes. This is normal."
              Melissa: "Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking 
              that we could go
              down..."
              [as Melissa continues to talk, Jerry starts imagining her gorgeously 
              naked,
              and stops paying attention]
              Melissa: "Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?"
              Jerry: "Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry."
              Melissa: "I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow."
              Jerry: "Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a..."
              [as Jerry continues to talk, Melissa starts imagining him disgustingly,
              'neanderthalishly' naked, and stops paying attention]

              Kramer, [in the shower, on the phone with Jerry]: "So you broke 
              up?"
              Jerry: "We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying 
              to picture her
              naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked."
              Kramer: "Hang on."
              [Kramer uses his shower garbage disposal to unclog the tub]
              Jerry: "So what are you up to?"
              Kramer: "Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. 
              Hey, how do you
              make those radish roses?"
              Jerry: "Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to 
              make it bloom,
              soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes."
              Kramer: "No problem there."

              Hanke, [working at a Baskin Robbins]: "George. Thanks for coming 
              down to talk
              to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't 
              very
              flexible. I just started yesterday."
              George: "Well, I'm here. What is it?"
              Hanke: "Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought 
              it over, and, you
              know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and 
              you deserve
              much better."
              George, ready to leave: "Well, thank you."
              Hanke: "You're welcome."
              Kid, [entering the store]: "Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint?"
              Hanke: "Waffle or sugar cone?"
              George: "Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get 
              into a big thing
              here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was 
              actually an
              apology."
              Hanke: "What?"
              Kid: "Can you get on that cone?"
              Hanke: "Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what 
              are you talking
              about?"
              George: "Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', 
              which is nice.
              It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology."
              Kid: "Is there anybody else here but you?"

              Hanke: "I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't 
              even think we
              have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I 
              admitted I
              was wrong, so what more do you want from me?"
              George: "I would like an apology."
              Hanke: "All right, look, you know--"
              Kid #2, [entering the store]: "Did you try it?"
              Kid: "No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing."
              Hanke: "Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK? I'm interacting with someone 
              here, if
              you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry."
              George: "Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I 
              want! Now say it
              again, and tell it to me."
              Hanke: "I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was 
              never sorry. It
              was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is 
              it? Can't
              find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice. Here we go. What 
              are you
              looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out!"

              Elaine, [eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy]: "Mmm. 
              This food is
              fantastic, Peggy: And what a pretty radish rose, huh?"
              Kramer: "Well, thank you."
              Elaine: "Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, 
              free."
              [all four make toast]
              Kramer: "Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install 
              a much needed
              and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub."
              [all four make another toast]
              Peggy: "You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub?"
              Kramer: "Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made 
              this whole meal in
              there."
              Elaine: "This food was in the shower with you?"
              Kramer: "Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed."
              [Peggy, Elaine, and Puddy all gag and wretch]
              Puddy: "Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!"

              George: "Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?"
              Puddy, waiting with Elaine and Peggy: "No, germ-o-phobes."
              George: "Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?"
              Elaine: "Kramer."
              George: "Right."

              Hanke, [speaking in front of other Rage-aholics]: "Hi, I'm, 
              uh, Jason. I'm a
              rage-aholic."
              Audience: "Hi, Jason."
              Hanke: "Uh, this is my first meeting."

              Step Nine!"
              Hanke: "Please. Step Nine."
              George: "That's right! He never apologized to me for saying 
              that I would
              stretch out the neck hole of his sweater."
              [audience laughs]
              George: "It wasn't funny."
              Hanke: "It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, 
              not to mention
              the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with 
              a v-neck."

              George: "Keep it real!"
              George: "Let's get nuts!"
              George, at Monk's with Jerry: "When are they gonna learn that 
              any news about
              China is an instant page-turner?"
              George, seeing Jerry with a small black device: "What's that?"
              Jerry: "It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm 
              goin' to Florida
              for his birthday."
              George: "How much was it?"
              Jerry: "Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't 
              care about the
              gift. He gets excited about the deal."
              George: "Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?"
              Jerry: "Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe 
              it's hot. That's
              his favorite."
              George: "I got a message from the Rosses at work today."
              Jerry: "Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to 
              them?"
              George: "At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, 
              I always kinda
              felt that they blamed me for Susan's death."
              Jerry: "Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? 
              That's silly."
              Elaine, entering Monk's with her boyfriend: "Oh, um... Darryl. 
              These are...
              people I know. Jerry, George."
              Darryl: "Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see 
              you later."
              Elaine: "OK."
              Jerry: "Still no Puddy?"
              Elaine: "Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just 
              gave up. Well,
              what do you think?"
              Jerry: "What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big 
              deal?"
              Elaine: "What black guy?"
              Jerry: "Darryl. He's black, isn't he?"
              Elaine: "He is?"
              George: "No, he isn't."
              Jerry: "Isn't he, Elaine?"
              Elaine: "You think?"
              George: "I thought he looked Irish."
              Jerry: "What's his last name?"
              Elaine: "Nelson."
              George: "That's not Irish."
              Jerry: "I think he's black."
              George: "Should we be talkin' about this?"
              Elaine: "I think it's OK."
              George: "No, it isn't."
              Jerry: "Why not?"
              George: "Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here."
              Jerry: "If he's black."
              Elaine: "Is he black?"
              Jerry: "Does it matter?"
              Elaine: "No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know."
              Jerry: "Oh, so you need to know?"
              Elaine: "No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be 
              nice if I knew."
              Waitress: "Should I take that?"
              Jerry, getting out his wallet: "Uh, one second."
              Elaine, looking in her purse: "Oh, here."
              George, pulling out some money: "Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... 
              yeah."
              [when they see the waitress, who is black, all three hurriedly get 
              out lots
              of money for her tip]

              George, with Jerry in his apartment, on the phone: "Uh, Mrs. 
              Ross? It's-it's
              George."
              Mrs. Ross: "Uh, who?"
              George: "George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no 
              speak."
              Mr. Ross, walking by Mrs. Ross: "We're all out of lime juice. 
              I told that
              woman to buy more."
              Mrs. Ross: "Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having 
              an event this
              weekend."
              George: "Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, 
              and I have got
              to get out there this weekend and sign the papers."
              Mr. Ross, again walking by: "I'm goin' back to bed."
              Mrs. Ross: "Thank you for calling, George."
              George: "Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... 
              OK, I gotta
              go."
              Jerry: "House in the Hamptons?"
              George: "Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for 
              a few years. I
              figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons."

              Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment to find Jerry and George: "Well."
              Jerry: "Hey."
              Kramer: "Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate."
              Jerry: "Wow. What are we celebrating?"
              Kramer: "Uh, you remember my coffee table book?"
              Jerry: "With the little legs?"
              Kramer: "That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned 
              it for a movie."
              George: "How are they gonna make that book into a movie?"
              Kramer: "You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?"
              George: "Yeah?"
              Kramer: "Independence Day?"
              George: "Oh."
              Jerry: "How much are they payin' you?"
              Kramer: "Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working 
              for a while.
              A long while."
              Jerry: "That's funny because I haven't seen you working for 
              a while. A long
              while."
              Kramer: "Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging 
              it up. Boys, I'm
              retiring."
              Jerry: "From what?"
              Kramer: "From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've 
              accomplished
              everything I've set out to do."
              Jerry, seeing that Kramer has a new watch: "What's that?"
              Kramer: "Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold 
              watch."
              Jerry and George: "Ooh!"
              Kramer: "Well, it's not really gold."
              Jerry and George: "Aww."

              [approaching Darryl's apartment, Elaine hears loud rap music being 
              played,
              and smiles knowingly]
              Elaine, as Darryl opens his door: "Hey."
              Darryl: "Hey."
              Elaine: "Great music."
              Darryl: "Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty 
              four hours a day.
              I hate it."
              Darryl: "Yo, you! Turn it down!"
              Elaine: "Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural 
              significance?"
              Darryl: "They're... African."
              Elaine: "Right. African."
              Darryl: "Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa."
              Elaine: "South Africa."
              Darryl: "My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out 
              years ago, for
              obvious reasons. You know how it is."
              Elaine: "Maybe."

              George, to a street vender selling hot dogs: "You must hate 
              hot dogs, huh? Or
              else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this."
              [the Rosses come out of a nearby building onto the street, observe 
              George not
              being in the Hamptons, and move on]
              George: "I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be 
              eatin' hot dogs
              all the time."
              Vender: "Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?"
              George: "Mmm... no."

              Morty, in Florida, as Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken 
              up:
              "Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!"
              Jerry: "It's 5:30 in the morning!"
              Helen: "We let you sleep in."
              Jerry, handing his dad a gift: "Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, 
              I got you a
              birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday."
              Morty: "Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents."
              Jerry: "What does that mean?"
              Helen: "Leave your father alone. It's his birthday."
              Morty: "Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector."
              Jerry: "Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty 
              miles an hour.

              You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard
              organizer."
              Morty: "This looks like too much money."
              Jerry: "Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, 
              fifty bucks."
              Morty: "You think it's hot?"
              Jerry: "Could be."
              Morty: "Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!"
              Helen: "I'm right here."
              Jerry: "And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, 
              fax, there's a
              calculator."
              Morty: "So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the 
              tip?"
              Jerry: "Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily 
              planner."
              Morty: "Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips."
              Helen: "Jerry, you're getting your father too excited."

              Kramer, entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a 
              neighbor:
              "Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?"
              Jerry: "Kramer, what are you doing here?"
              Kramer: "I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door."
              Helen: "Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment."
              Kramer: "Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped 
              on it."
              Jerry: "Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people 
              come to die."
              Jerry, getting looks from his parents: "Not you. Older people."
              Helen: "Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. 
              How 'bout a
              feta cheese omelette?"
              Kramer: "Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom."
              Jerry: "If you feed him, he'll never leave."
              Helen: "We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and 
              Egg Beaters?"
              Kramer, immaturely: "I guess."
              Jerry: "I can't believe this."
              Kramer: "I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?"

              Elaine, with George at Monk's: "So, George, do you have any 
              thoughts on this
              Darryl situation?"
              George: "Actually, I did have a thought."
              Elaine: "Oh."
              George: "Why don't you just ask him?"
              Elaine, rudely and giving him a 'duh' look: "Because, if I 
              ask him, then it's
              like I really want to know."
              George: "Maybe he's, um... mixed."
              Elaine: "Is that the right word?"
              George: "I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' 
              about this."
              Elaine: "Yeah."
              George, standing up: "I'm just gonna go to the bathroom."
              Elaine, starting to leave: "You know what, I'm leavin'."
              George: "Yeah."
              Elaine: "I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back."
              Elaine, seeing the Rosses entering Monk's: "Oh. Mrs. Ross, 
              Mr. Ross."
              Mrs. Ross: "Oh, you're George's friend."
              Mr. Ross: "We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened 
              to his
              place in the Hamptons?"
              Elaine, laughing uproariously: "The Hamptons? George Costanza? 
              I, uh... I
              don't think so. Have a good one."
              George: "Rosses."
              Mr. Ross: "George, we were just talking about you."
              George: "Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But 
              this was one of
              those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about."
              Mrs. Ross: "Really?"
              George: "Yeah, I may move out there."
              George, getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses: "I mean 
              it, I'll do
              it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!"

              Morty, eating lunch with Helen and Jerry: "Another fine meal, 
              and now for my
              Wizard tip calculator."
              Jerry: "Dad, it's got lots of other functions."
              Morty: "Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions."
              Morty, trying to open it: "I can't get it open."
              [Jerry easily opens it]
              Helen: "Yay! Jerry got it open."
              Morty: "The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill 
              the water.
              How does 12.4% sound?"
              Jerry, looking at the Wizard: "Well, your tip is four dollars 
              and thirty-six
              point six six six six cents."
              Morty: "We'll round down."
              Helen: "Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your 
              father's
              birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections."
              Jerry: "Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because 
              you were
              impeached at the other condo."
              Morty: "I was never impeached! I resigned!"
              Helen: "Even so, the press would bury him!"
              Jerry: "What press?"
              Helen: "The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze."
              Morty: "Pinko Commie rag."

              Old Man, coming up to the three Seinfelds: "Hey, Morty. Your 
              boy here, he
              just got a date with that young aquacise instructor."
              Jerry: "She's fifty."
              Old Man: "You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's 
              my man."
              Kramer: "All right, I'll see you guys."
              Old Man: "Yeah."
              Kramer: "Yeah."
              [Kramer, scanning the scene, is surprised to see Morty, right next 
              to him,
              staring at his face]
              Kramer, taping Morty's glasses: "Morty, what're you lookin' 
              at?"
              Morty: "I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president 
              of Del
              Boca Vista, Phase Three."
              Kramer: "Hmm."

              Darryl, with Elaine in his apartment: "Elaine, thank you for 
              the Wizard!"
              [Elaine laughts somewhat awkwardly]
              Darryl: "Wow, it's got so many functions."
              Elaine: "Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is 
              first. Warranty
              information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball..."
              Darryl: "Well, I don't do that stuff."
              Elaine: "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. 
              Um. Oh,
              here's one: race."
              Darryl: "Isn't that optional?"
              Elaine: "It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! 
              But they really
              would like to know."
              Darryl: "All right, I'm... Asian."
              Elaine: "What?"
              Darryl: "Just to mess with 'em."
              Elaine: laughing awkwardly: "Oh. Right. Good one."
              Darryl: "Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand."
              Elaine: "Really?"
              Darryl: "Does that matter?"
              Elaine: "No, but... it is very nice to know."

              Jerry, in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine: "So 
              did you figure
              out Darryl's... you know."
              Elaine, in Jerry's apartment: "Ah, I've given up. So, now we're 
              going to a
              bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way."
              Jerry, as Kramer walks by: "You're a master of race relations."
              Elaine: "Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?"
              Jerry: "Yeah, it's all my father's doing."
              [Kramer, apparently looking for something to do, mumbles to Jerry 
              to hand him
              a magazine from the table]
              Jerry: "He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then 
              wield power
              from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse."
              Elaine: "Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?"
              Jerry: "Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair."
              George, entering Jerry's apartment: "Jerry?"
              Elaine, to George: "He's still down with his folks."
              George, to Elaine: "What are you doin' here?"
              Jerry, overhearing the other two: "Elaine, Elaine--"
              Elaine, to George: "I'm gettin' his mail."
              Jerry, overhearing the other two: "Oh, no."
              George, to Elaine: "He asked you to get the mail?"
              Elaine, to George: "Mm-hmm."
              George, taking the phone from Elaine: "Jerry, why is Elaine 
              getting your
              mail?"
              Jerry: "George, listen to me. I have a very important job for 
              you. I want you
              to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't 
              dry out and
              leak."
              Elaine, trying to understand what they're talking about: "What?"
              George: "What about the mail?"
              Jerry: "This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, 
              George."
              George, hanging up: "All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya."

              George, with Elaine in Jerry's apartment: "So, I ran into the 
              Rosses again."
              Elaine: "Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get 
              the idea that you
              have a place in the Hamptons?"
              George: "From me."
              Elaine: "What did you say?"
              George: "I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did 
              you say?"
              Elaine: "I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed."
              George: "So, they knew? Those liars!"
              Elaine: "But you lied first."

              George: "Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, 
              they
              never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're 
              lying.
              You call them a liar!"
              Elaine: "Like you're a liar!"
              George: "Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?"
              Elaine: "So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over."
              George: "Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses 
              and inviting
              them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see 
              who blinks
              first."
              Elaine: "Haven't you done enough to these people?"
              George: "This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, 
              I have to exercise
              Jerry's gaskets."
              [Elaine gets a sarcastic, 'oh, boy' expression]

              Kramer, to a room: "Vote for Kramer."
              Kramer, to a man walking by: "Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for 
              condo president.
              I'd like your vote. Thanks."
              Kramer, to an old woman: "Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is 
              a vote for
              Kramer."
              Old Woman: "Will you cut my meat?"
              Kramer: "Gladly."

              Waitress, to Darryl, who's with Elaine at Monk's: "Coffee?"
              Darryl: "Sure."
              Waitress, to Darryl: "Are you black? Or should I bring some 
              cream."
              Darryl: "I'm black."
              Darryl, re-thinking: "Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream."
              Darryl, seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine: "Did 
              you hear that?"
              Elaine: "What?"
              Darryl: "God, there are still people who have trouble with 
              an interracial
              couple."
              Elaine: "Interracial? Us?"
              Darryl: "Isn't that unbelievable!?"
              Elaine: "Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial 
              couple.
              That is racism!"
              Darryl: "I don't feel like eating."
              Elaine: "Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club."

              George: "So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons."
              Mrs. Ross: "Sounds grand."
              George: "Do you have your bathing suits?"
              Mr. Ross: "It's March."
              George: "Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's 
              a two-hour drive.
              Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. 
              All
              right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!"

              Jerry, in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room: 
              "Hey,
              Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you 
              need to take
              a vitamin."
              Jerry, as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic 
              sweatsuit:
              "Dad, you look so different."
              Kramer: "Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, 
              one... must
              walk among them."
              Morty, coming into the hall: "This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's 
              the
              election!"
              Kramer: "Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. 
              But then
              when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight 
              p.m."
              Jerry: "You know, you can put that whole schedule right in 
              your daily
              planner."
              Morty: "Daily what?"
              Helen, coming into the condo: "Have you read today's Boca Breeze?"
              Kramer, looking at the newsletter: "Hey, look at that. Picture 
              of me, huh?"
              Kramer, reading out loud: "Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot 
              in
              clubhouse."
              Morty: "Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is 
              against the
              rules."
              Kramer: "Well, I couldn't find my shoes."
              Jerry: "Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives 
              to move down
              here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules."
              Helen: "Who wants hot chocolate?"
              Kramer: "Oh, yeah! Me."
              Morty: "This is a huge scandal! We need damage control."
              Kramer: "All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, 
              huh?"
              Jerry: "Wizards!"
              Kramer: "Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every 
              member on the
              condo board."
              Jerry: "Kramer..."
              Morty: "There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you 
              can get that
              deal."
              Kramer: "Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what 
              do we next,
              Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?"
              Morty, rushing to his bedroom: "First, I need a nap."
              Helen, running after him: "Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!"
              Jerry: "Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards."
              Kramer: "Well, what about your deal, huh?"
              Jerry: "I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a 
              pop. What do I
              do?"
              Kramer: "Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy."
              Jerry: "Down here?"
              Kramer: "Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father."

              George, driving in the car with the Rosses: "And that leads 
              into the master
              bedroom."
              Mrs. Ross: "Tell us more."
              George: "You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into 
              the solarium."
              Mr. Ross: "Another solarium?"
              George: "Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, 
              too?"
              Mr. Ross: "What are their names?"
              George: "Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?"
              Mrs. Ross: "Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy 
              you a
              housewarming gift."
              George, chuckling to himself: "Housewarming gift."
              George, swerving the car to go to the antique stand: "All right, 
              we're taking
              it up a notch!"

              Waitress at Monk's, handing Elaine a menu: "Here you go."
              Elaine, to the black waitress: "Long day?"
              Waitress: "Yeah, I just worked a triple shift."
              Elaine: "I hear ya, Sister."
              Waitress: "Sister?"
              Elaine, as Darryl comes into Monk's: "Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's 
              black.
              Here he is. See?"
              Darryl: "Hi, Elaine."
              Elaine: "Hey."
              Waitress: "He's black?"
              Elaine: "Yeah."
              Darryl: "I'm black?"
              Elaine: "Aren't you?"
              Waitress, leaving: "I'll give you a couple minutes to decide."
              Darryl: "What are you talking about?"
              Elaine: "You're black. You said we were an interracial couple."
              Darryl: "We are. Because you're Hispanic."
              Elaine: "I am?"
              Darryl: "Aren't you?"
              Elaine: "No. Why would you think that?"
              Darryl: "Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking 
              me to those
              Spanish restaurants."
              Elaine: "That's because I thought you were black."
              Darryl: "Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because 
              I'm black?"
              Elaine: "I don't think we should be talking about this."
              Darryl: "So, what are you?"
              Elaine: "I'm white."
              Darryl: "So, we're just a couple of white people?"
              Elaine: "I guess."
              Darryl: "Oh."
              Elaine: "Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?"
              Darryl, leaving with Elaine: "Sure."

              Kramer, having lunch with Jerry and his parents: "Oh, well... 
              I handed out
              all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think 
              we've got
              this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman 
              Burgerman,
              he won't be leavin' any tips where he is."
              Jerry: "Aw."
              Morty: "Congratulations, Mr. President."
              Kramer: "Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master."
              Old Man: "Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?"
              Morty: "What are you talking about?"
              Old Man: "It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT."
              Morty: "This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard."
              Jerry: "A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!"
              Old Man #2: "Mine doesn't have a seven!"
              Old Man #3: "I'm ruined!"
              Morty: "Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?"
              Jerry: "Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars."
              Morty: "You didn't have a deal?"
              Jerry: "No deal. Not hot."
              Old Man: "Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished."
              Kramer: "What?"
              Old Man: "Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair."

              Kramer, getting up to leave: "Well, the people have spoken. 
              Well, that's it
              for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York."
              Jerry: "Dad, I'm sorry."
              Morty: "You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars 
              on a tip
              calculator?!"
              Jerry: "It does other things!"

              Mr. Ross, with his wife and George, on a beach: "Where are 
              we, George?"
              George: "Almost there."
              Mr. Ross: "Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your 
              house?"
              George: "We, uh, we go on foot from here."
              Mr. Ross: "All right."
              George: "There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. 
              There's no
              Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium."
              Mr. Ross: "We know."
              George: "Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out 
              here? Why
              didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?"
              Mrs. Ross: "We don't like you, George."
              Mr. Ross: "And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan."
              George: "Oh."
              Mr. Ross: "All right! Let's head back."

        First scene.
        Elaine is getting ready to drive Puddy's car, he's giving her last minute
        instructions.

        Puddy: Alright, be careful with the car, babe.

        Elaine: Yeah, yeah.

        Puddy: And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.

        Elaine: Goodbye?

        Puddy: Two and ten, babe.

        Elaine: Okay.

        Puddy: Don't peel out.

        Elaine: I won't.

        Elaine peels out and turns on the car stereo. She hears: "Jesus is 
        one, Jesus
        is all, Jesus picks me up when I fall..." Elaine changes the stations 
        but all
        of the presets are set to religious radio stations; "And he said 
        unto
        Abraham...", "Amen! Amen!", "So we pray...", 
        "Saved!", "Jey-sus!" She turns
        off the radio.

        Elaine: Jesus?

        Meeting at George's office. His Boss, Mr. Kruger, is speaking.

        Kruger: According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing 
        is
        heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?

        George: Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off 
        my rent
        check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.

        Kruger: Works for me. Good thinking, George.

        Co-worker 1: Alright, George.

        Co-worker 2: Way to go man.

        George: Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend
        we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."

        Kruger: Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.

        Co-worker 1: Good one.

        Co-worker 2: That was bad.

        George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.

        George: I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.

        JerrY: And then?

        George: I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during 
        a
        meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.

        Jerry: Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight 
        and
        walk off.

        George: I can't just leave.

        Jerry: That's the way they do it in Vegas.

        George: You never played Vegas.

        Jerry: I hear things.

        Elaine enters and has a seat.

        Elaine: Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his 
        radio
        were Christian rock stations.

        George: I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those 
        real
        musicians who think they're so cool and hip.

        Elaine: So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?

        Jerry: It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.

        Elaine: Yes, he is lazy.

        Jerry: Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.

        Elaine: Yes, he is dumb.

        Jerry: So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?

        Elaine: Dumb and lazy, I understand.

        George: Tell you how you could check.

        Elaine: How?

        George: Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? 
        The
        old switcheroo.

        Jerry: No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch 
        it
        with the other person's.

        George: No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.

        Jerry: Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the 
        radio
        did to her.

        George: Well that's the gist of it!

        Elaine: Quiet! So where is this Sophie?

        Jerry: Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.

        Elaine: How long have you two been together?

        Jerry: I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?

        Elaine and George: Nah.

        Jerry leaves to go meet Sophie by the register.

        George: By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?

        Elaine: I needed to move a bureau.

        Kramer: Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?

        Mickey: Hey Jerry.

        Jerry: Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.

        Kramer: Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should
        sound like that, something like that.

        Mickey: Aah-choo.

        Kramer: A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.

        Jerry: What's with the fake sneezing?

        Kramer: Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors 
        to
        help the students practice diagnosing.

        Mickey: They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. 
        It's
        an easy gig.

        Jerry: Do medical schools actually do this?

        Kramer: Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.

        Kramer and Mickey: HUAAHHH!!

        Jerry: I think the phone is ringing.

        Kramer and Mickey: HUAAHHH!!

        Jerry: Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here 
        with
        that stuff?

        Kramer: Mickey, DTs.

        Kramer and Mickey exit, shaking, while Jerry answers the phone.

        Jerry: Hello?

        Sophie: Hey. It's me.

        Jerry: Elaine?

        Sophie: No, it's me.

        Jerry: George??

        Sophie: Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice.

        Jerry: Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.

        Kramer enters.

        Kramer: You got any Ipecac?

        Jerry: Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with 
        this.

        Kramer: No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.

        Jerry: Did he overdose?

        Kramer: No, it's just too much.


        New scene.
        Office meeting at Kruger Industrial Smoothing.

        Kruger: ...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette
        Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the 
        size of
        a softball, and that spells trouble.

        George: Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick 
        a
        pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?

        Everyone at the meeting breaks out in laughter.

        George (getting up and leaving): Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight
        everybody.


        New scene.
        Mt. Sanai Hospital, a woman in a lab coat is handing out envelopes to 
        a group of
        people, Mickey and Kramer included.

        Dr. Wexler: In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned 
        and
        the symptoms you will need to exhibit.

        Mickey: Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!

        Kramer: Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?

        Mickey: Sorry buddy, this is the "Hamlet" of diseases. Severe 
        pain, nausea,
        delusions, it's got everything.

        Kramer (to the man beside him): Howbout you, do you wanna trade?

        Man: Sure.

        Kramer: Okay, what do you got?

        Man: The surgeon left a sponge inside me.

        Kramer: Good luck with that.


        New scene.
        George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.

        George: I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was 
        gone.

        Jerry: What did you do the rest of the day?

        George: I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, 
        right?

        Jerry: And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.

        Elaine enters.

        Elaine: Hello boys.

        George: Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?

        Elaine: I did.

        George: And the Christian rock?

        Elaine: Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus 
        fish!

        George: Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?

        Jerry: No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?

        Elaine: Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel
        misled.

        George: I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.

        Jerry: I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on 
        the phone today.

        Elaine: "It's me?" Isn't it a little premature?

        Jerry: I thought so.

        Elaine: Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".

        George: I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, 
        it's
        like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!

        Kramer enters.

        Kramer: Well, I got gonorrhea.

        Elaine: That seems about right.

        Kramer: That's what they gave me.

        George: They? The Government?

        Jerry: No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can 
        diagnose
        it.

        Kramer: And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, 
        he
        got bacterial meningitis.

        George: I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.

        The other three start laughing.

        George (leaving): Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.

        Elaine: What was that?

        Jerry: Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.

        Kramer: See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.

        Jerry: Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the 
        back
        row.


        Kramer: Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and 
        feel the
        gonorrhea themselves.


        New scene.
        Mt. Sanai Hospital. Kramer is on the table surrounded by med students.

        Student #1: And are you experiencing any discomfort?

        Kramer: Just a little burning during urination.

        Student #1: Okay, any other pain?

        Kramer: The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) 
        
        Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes 
        met
        across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. 
        
        Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so 
        we
        danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that 
        I would
        experience soon afterwards.

        Student #1: Gonorrhea?!

        Kramer: Gonorrhea!

        The lab breaks out in spontaneous applause as Mickey turns up the lights 
        and
        Kramer takes a bow.


        New scene.
        Jerry and George are back at Jerry's apartment. Jerry is checking his 
        phone
        messages.

        Jerry: One message. Hope it's not from you.

        Answering machine: "Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back."

        Jerry: Sophie.

        George: She's still doing that?

        Jerry: Yep.

        George: Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give 
        her the
        "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.

        Jerry: I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the 
        gander".

        George: What the hell is a gander, anyway?

        Jerry (picking up the phone and dialing): It's a goose that's had the 
        old
        switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.

        Sophie: Hey Raef.

        Jerry (to George): She thinks it's someone named Raef.

        George: Good, let her think it.

        Jerry (into the phone, with a disguised voice): So, what's going on?

        Sophie: Not a lot.

        George: Ask about you, ask about you.

        Jerry: So, uh, how are things with Jerry?

        Sophie: Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the 
        tractor
        story.

        Jerry: Right, right, the tractor story.

        Sophie: Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny.

        Jerry: I sound funny?

        George: Abort! Abort!

        Jerry: Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! 
        What
        drives me to take chances like that?

        George: That was very real.

        Jerry: She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.

        George: Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?

        Jerry: Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?

        Elaine: So where do you wanna eat?

        Puddy: Feels like an Arby's night.

        Elaine: Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?

        Puddy: Yes.

        Elaine: Oh. So, you're pretty religious?

        Puddy: That's right.

        Elaine: So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?

        Puddy: Not for me.

        Elaine: Why not?

        Puddy: I'm not the one going to hell.


        New scene.
        Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

        George: You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.

        Jerry: No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. 
        We're
        dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.

        George: Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?

        Jerry: No, she looks completely normal.

        George: Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor
        accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.

        Jerry: You think she's got toes for thumbs?

        George: How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too
        firm?

        Jerry: I don't know.

        George: Hands a little smelly?

        Jerry: Why do I seek your counsel?

        Elaine walks in.

        Elaine: Well I'm going to hell.

        Jerry: That seems about right.

        Elaine: According to Puddy.

        Jerry: Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee 
        and
        the doughtnuts and--

        Elaine: I'm not in the mood.

        George (To a passing waitress): I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.

        Jerry: What do you care? You don't believe in hell.

        Elaine: I know, but he does.

        Jerry: So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination 
        of
        your soul.

        Elaine: Well, relationships are very important to me.

        Jerry: Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you 
        burn for
        all eternity.

        George (to the waitress bringing his doughnut): And a slice of devil's 
        food
        cake.

        Kruger's office. George enters, seeing nobody but Mr. Kruger.

        George: Hey. Where is everyone?

        Mr. Kruger: They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you 
        are my
        main man.

        George: I am?


        Mr. Kruger: I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but 
        lately
        you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.

        George: This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and
        folders.

        Mr. Kruger: Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.

        George: Okay.

        Mr. Kruger: George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair)
        Three times around, no feet.

        George: And?

        Mr. Kruger: All me.


        New scene.
        Kramer and Mickey are back at Mt. Sinai.

        Dr. Wexler: Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, 
        Mr.
        Kramer, you were excellent.

        Kramer: Oh, thank you.

        Mickey: Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! 
        
        What did you get?

        Kramer: Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had
        gonorrhea last week.

        Dr. Wexler: Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it.

        Kramer: I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.


        New scene.
        Jerry and Sophie are at Jerry's playing chess.

        Sophie: I move my knight... here. Check.

        Jerry: They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe
        they should change it to a tractor.

        Sophie: Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?

        Jerry: Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought 
        the
        farm.

        Sophie: Bought the farm?

        Jerry: Tractor!

        Sophie: This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable.

        Jerry: Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.

        Sophie drops her purse and when she bends down to pick it up, Jerry nods
        knowingly.


        New scene.
        Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

        George: A scar?

        Jerry: A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?

        George: A tractor.

        Jerry: I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk 
        about
        it.

        George: I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her 
        toe
        thumbs.

        Jerry: She doesn't have toe thumbs.

        George: Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--

        Jerry: Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?

        George: Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for
        hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with 
        sleep
        creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was 
        that he
        finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, 
        George
        sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe 
        this. 
        This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? 
        Who
        said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?

        Mr. Kruger: I'm not too worried about it.

        George: Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I 
        put in
        your shoebox?

        Mr. Kruger: Alright, alright I'm going.

        George (to Jerry): Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?

        Jerry: Never.


        New scene.
        Elaine's hallway. The door opens, Puddy steps out in his bathrobe. There's 
        a
        newspaper in front of the door across from Elaine's.

        Puddy: Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you 
        just
        grab that one.

        Elaine: 'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.

        Puddy: C'mon, get it.

        Elaine: Well if you want it, you get it.

        Puddy: Sorry, thou shalt not steal.

        Elaine: Oh, but it's ok for me?

        Puddy: What do you care, you know where you're going.

        Elaine: Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.

        Puddy: Nah.

        Elaine: C'mon.

        Puddy: Alright, what did I do?

        Elaine: David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils
        and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! 
        I
        mean, what do you think about all that?

        Puddy: Gonna be rough.

        Elaine: Uh, you should be trying to save me!

        Puddy: Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.

        Elaine: I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you 
        should
        care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.

        Puddy: You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?

        Elaine: Yeah, that's right!

        Elaine places her hands beside her head, index fingers raised as 'horns' 
        and she
        emits a gutteral growling sound.


        New scene.
        Mt Sanai Hospital. The actors are gathered. Mickey is practicing his part.

        Mickey: Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look 
        for
        love in a bottle?

        Dr. Wexler: Mr. Kramer? You're up.

        Kramer walks in, his face is noticably yellow.

        Mickey: Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?

        Kramer: Well, we'll see.

        Student #2: So, what seems to be bothering you today, Mr. Kramer?

        Kramer (pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket): Well, I guess 
        it
        started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this 
        was the
        only friend I had left.

        Mickey: Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps
        Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.

        They fall to the floor, wrestling.

        Student #2: Cirrhosis of the liver and PCP addiction?


        New scene.

        Elaine and Puddy have gone to see a priest, Father Curtis.

        Father Curtis: Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that 
        he isn't
        concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy.

        Elaine and Puddy: Yeah, that's right.

        Father Curtis: Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples 
        have
        difficulty--

        Elaine (Interrupting): Woah, woah, woah! No one's getting married here.

        Father Curtis: You aren't?

        Puddy: No.

        Elaine: We're just, you know, having a good time.

        Father Curtis: Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell.

        Puddy: No way, this is bogus, man!

        Elaine: Well, thank you father.

        Father Curtis: Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's 
        talkng
        to the devil by the coffee machine?

        Puddy: I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.

        Elaine: Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.

        Elaine makes the same 'fingers up' devil gesture as she did in her apartment 
        and
        Father Curtis joins in.


        New scene.
        Jerry and Sophie ar at Jerry's apartment.

        Sophie: You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about. 
        
        See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult.

        Jerry: Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with 
        it.

        Sophie: How could you know?

        Jerry (putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back 
        to
        Sopie's): Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not
        gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term 
        and
        meaningful relationship.

        Kramer and Mickey barge in, they're in the middle of an argument.

        Kramer: ...I didn't say that, no.

        Mickey: You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!

        Kramer: Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd 
        have fun
        with it.

        Jerry: Hey, hey! I'm with someone.

        Kramer: Oh. Hello.

        Sophie: No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The
        important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.

        Kramer (to Mickey): You know? She's right.

        Sophie: Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a
        tractor.

        Jerry: You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor
        story??

        Kramer: You can't get it from that.

        Sophie: But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor
        in my bathing suit.

        Jerry (walking out): Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight
        everybody.

        Kruger is bouncing a ball against the wall and catching it. George is
        percolating.

        George: Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?

        Mr. Kruger: You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.

        George: No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your
        name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off 
        and
        all it says now is K-uger!

        Mr. Kruger: K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, 
        huh? 
        K-uger! K-uger!

        George: Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!

        Mr. Kruger (getting up to leave): Thank you George, you've been great.
